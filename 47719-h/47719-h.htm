<hr class="r5" />

<p>A part of the information upon which these observations
are founded was obtained for my own guidance, in considering
the complaints as to Railway rates and the comparisons
between railways in the United Kingdom and abroad. At the
suggestion of the representatives of some of the Companies the
subject was followed up. These observations have expanded
beyond my original intentions; but they have been prepared
for a limited object; they do not purport to exhaust the
subject. I have endeavoured to treat it fairly, and to pay
due regard alike to the interests of the traders, the public,
and the railway companies; interests which may, to a hasty
observer, occasionally appear conflicting, but which, looked
at reasonably, and in the light of full information, are seen
to be identical.</p>

<p>Though solely responsible for the comments and conclusions,
I am indebted for the information upon which they
are based to many persons; among others, to several of the
Presidents, General Managers, and others connected with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi_a" id="Page_vi_a">[Pg vi]</a></span>
the control of the railways in France, Belgium and Holland;
to Sir Bernhard Samuelson, M.P. (who placed at my disposal
the voluminous and useful information which he obtained as
to the railways in Germany, Belgium and Holland); to some
of the General Managers and other Officers of the companies
in England, the United States, and Canada; and to many
friends who have been kind enough to supply much information
and give valuable assistance.</p>

<p>If the information thus collected helps to clear up some
misconceptions, to prevent the adoption of theories as to the
fixing of rates which would be most injurious to the trade of
the country, and to bring about an equitable and satisfactory
settlement of questions now so much discussed, my object
will have been attained.</p>

<h2>SECTION I.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">INTRODUCTION.</span></h2>

<p>For many reasons the failure to pass the Railway and
Canal Traffic Bill ought not to be regretted even by those
who are dissatisfied with railway companies, but who
sincerely desire to benefit the trade of the country. In the
discussion of that Bill, and in the debates on the subject
of railway rates in recent sessions of Parliament, the
existence of many misconceptions were disclosed. As to
principles, there was little agreement; there was, if possible,
still less as to details. Charges which had often been
explained or refuted were repeated as if they were new,
and as if they had never been answered. One of the
greatest defects of the discussion was its fragmentary, one-sided
character; it was carried on with far too little
regard to the interests of many classes, districts, and ports
which would have been seriously injured by some of the
changes hastily proposed. Many of those who professed to
represent traders ignored the interests of large sections of
them; and what would benefit consumers was, to a remarkable
degree, lost sight of. The delay may be useful; and it
may be hoped that any future legislation will be shaped
according to the interests of all traders, and not of a part
of them only, and of the general public, to whom extended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
and not restricted trade, cheapness, and a wide area of
supply are desirable.</p>

<p>The following observations do not attempt to correct or
remove all the misconceptions in circulation, or to answer all
the charges against English railway companies. Many of
such charges are so vague as to elude refutation; they appear
formidable, but only formidable because they are indefinite.
Nor is this an attempt to show that, with regard to railway
working and rates, all is done for the best by the companies.
Considering the fact that the rates are numbered by millions,
and the variety of interests which they affect&mdash;considering,
too, the fact that this is an island with numerous ports, companies
and trading interests, all competing with each other&mdash;it
would be amazing if there were no anomalies and defects.
The present purpose is only to show that of the charges
brought against railway companies some are erroneous;
that some are exaggerated; that many are of a contradictory
character; that some are complaints of evils which railway
companies did not create and cannot alter; and that other
supposed grievances could not be removed without injury to
the community. It has recently been stated in Parliament
that &#8220;this is the first time that traders have had an
opportunity of going before a tribunal and putting their
views fairly before it.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
This betrays forgetfulness of the fact that, as lately as 1881 and 1882,
during two sessions, a Select Committee heard the complaints of all
persons who believed that they had grievances to
relate. The statement, too, inadvertently ignores the fact
that, when the companies submitted in the session of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
1885 Bills to Parliament, and thus offered a further opportunity
of inquiry, Chambers of Commerce and other persons
professing to represent trades refused to avail themselves
of the opportunity, and prevented the investigation taking
place. English railway companies need not dread a thorough
examination of their working, or a comparison with any
foreign system. They need be apprehensive only of a vague
uninstructed notion that &#8220;something must be done;&#8221; of
legislation adopted, if not in a panic, in a time of greatly
depressed trade; of crude one-sided proposals made on behalf
of a part of the interests concerned by persons who have
not sufficiently examined and considered all the consequences
of their schemes; and of the application of a standard of
perfection supposed to exist somewhere, but in truth nowhere
realized.</p>

<p>The continued depression of trade, the necessary efforts
to reduce the cost of production, jealousy of foreign competition,
misapprehensions fostered by agitation, as to the
commercial effects of &#8220;special,&#8221; &#8220;import,&#8221; and &#8220;transit&#8221;
rates, have given birth to vague, ill-considered proposals,
some of which would be certain to injure the cause which
their authors have most at heart.</p>

<p>One point is at the outset very clear&mdash;the inconsistent
nature of many of the charges made against railway companies.
Within the last twenty years such complaints have been the
subject of three elaborate inquiries before Royal Commissions
or Parliamentary Committees<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. Before all of them were
submitted proposals completely at variance with each other.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
With equal emphasis railways are now asked to satisfy
contradictory demands; and to a large extent the multifarious
charges made against them answer or cancel each other.
Many traders demand the very opposite of what is a
necessity to others, and of what consumers, naturally anxious
to enlarge the field of supply, earnestly desire. Some of
the former complain, for example, in language which seems
borrowed from mediæval times, that their &#8220;geographical&#8221; or
&#8220;natural advantages&#8221; are diminished. Other traders blame
railway companies for not sufficiently effacing natural disadvantages,
and not offering inducements for the development
of trade in new districts. Exporters want favourable
terms; importers do the same; and another class protests
against concessions either in favour of exports or imports.
It is a remarkable fact that many of the proposals which
were most in fashion a few years ago have now been abandoned,
and that in Parliament and the Press we now hear
chiefly of schemes totally different from those which were
formerly supported. Equal mileage rates were once strongly
advocated; and, probably owing to the great success of the
Penny Post and to the experiences of the advantages of
one uniform rate for all distances, there was a belief in some
minds that, with certain modifications, the same principle
might be applied to rates for goods. Ingenious schemes were
devised for equalizing within certain zones or areas, rates
irrespective of distance and other circumstances. There is a
fashion in so-called Railway Reform. Such schemes are now
little heard of; they have given place to proposals essentially
different, which may in their turn make way for others.</p>

<p>In all the recent discussions of rates much was heard of
those who were discontented, but very little of those who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
being satisfied, were silent. Most errors in Political Economy,
it has been said, come from not taking into account what is
not seen. Especially true is this of the question of railway
rates, not the least important problem of Political Economy.
Of the trades and interests which are dissatisfied with
existing arrangements, people hear and see much. Unfortunately
they appear to take little heed of other interests,
equally important, which are contented, or comparatively
so, which do not send deputations to the Board of Trade, and
which changes such as have been from time to time proposed
would injure or even go far to ruin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>SECTION II.<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">THE PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH RATES SHOULD BE BASED.</span></h2>

<p>The first condition of any useful discussion of railway
rates is that <i>all</i> interests shall be considered&mdash;the interests
of all traders, and of all consumers, as well as of railway
companies. To every proposal this test&mdash;the golden rule&mdash;should
be applied. How would any projected change affect
all concerned? Every one cannot get such rates as he
would desire; the utmost which is practicable is to fix them
in the manner, on the whole, most suitable to the requirements
of the community as a whole; and this will be found in the
long run to coincide with the interests of the companies. In
consequence of not applying this test, and owing to the fact
that persons may freely put forward proposals without
explaining what would be the consequences of a general application
of their principle, little progress is made in the
discussion. A second condition of any profitable consideration
of the subject is obvious. To argue about the
propriety of this or that rate, the question whether this
town or that port is badly treated, or this or that industry
is made to pay too much, is of little use without agreement
as to the principle upon which rates ought to be framed.
There is a third condition no less reasonable. When
English railway companies are accused of imposing charges
at haphazard, and in an arbitrary fashion, what scientific
principle, it may be asked, ought to be followed? There is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
no escaping this question&mdash;not even if the task of framing
or controlling rates were committed, as has sometimes been
proposed, to the Board of Trade or the Railway Commissioners.
To this question rarely, however, is any answer
given. When one is attempted, very seldom is it made
with reference to all interests meriting attention.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
How often do witnesses before Royal Commissions or in Parliamentary
inquiries merely deprecate in general language what they
object to as personally injurious, or merely claim what would
be advantageous for themselves! How often is their proposal
of reform merely a thinly veiled plan for securing <i>protection</i>
against competition for some industry or some town or port!
How many proposals as to rates, propounded with facility and
confidence in Chambers of Commerce, would prove to be valueless
or even objectionable if their authors were always obliged
to answer in detail two questions. What would be the effect
of the proposals on consumers? How would they affect
producers and traders generally?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>SECTION III.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">COST OF SERVICE.</span></h2>

<p>One favourite proposal, often refuted but constantly
renewed, is to base rates on the actual cost of conveyance
<i>plus</i> a reasonable return on the capital invested. Whether
this would benefit the trade of the country we shall by
and by consider.</p>

<p>But it is no light presumption against this principle that,
though so often proposed, especially by theorists, nowhere
has it been carried out. Obviously cost of conveyance
bears no relation to value of goods&mdash;the mere transit
of some descriptions of very valuable goods costs as little
as that of low priced articles. It will be generally found that
when pressed, the advocates of this theory are not prepared
to maintain that for a cwt. of coals and a cwt. of copper
the charge should be the same. They shrink from the application
of their own principle, recognising, as is the fact,
that it is absolutely inconsistent with any classification of
goods, such as traders and the Board of Trade have been
urging the companies to adopt.</p>

<p>Inconsistent as such a principle is with any kind of
classification of goods, and leading to the consequence that
a rate might be the same for a bale of cotton as for high
priced silks, its effect might be to revolutionize trade. But
there is a preliminary difficulty; how is the cost of conveyance
to be ascertained with anything like accuracy?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
How is the cost of conveying a particular consignment or
even the average cost of every kind of traffic to be found?
What the transit of full loads of coal in this country,
or of grain in America, from point A to point B costs
may be approximately found. Allowances may be made
for the maintenance of the permanent way, for cost of
engine power, and the wages of drivers, guards, &amp;c.; and
calculations, more or less accurate, can be made as to the cost
of conveyance even over lines of varying gradients. The
solution even of this simple form of problem would be
difficult. When in cases before the Railway Commissioners
it has been attempted to discover the <i>actual</i> cost of conveying
a particular kind of traffic, the operation has been laborious.
The companies interested have been compelled to incur
great expense in procuring returns and information, and
the result has in general been only approximately
accurate. Very complex and difficult is the real problem.
A large portion of the traffic of the country is carried in
trains which pick up and set down wagons at intermediate
stations. In the same truck may be goods of all classes and
different quality or bulk for different destinations. One
article of great bulk and light weight may be carried in a
truck by itself or along with articles of great weight and
small bulk.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
There is a further difficulty in the fact that, while
certain fixed expenses remain much the same, no matter
what may be the volume of traffic, the movement or operating
expenses increase with the traffic. It may be confidently
stated that no trustworthy data as to the cost of conveying
each consignment or each class of goods in the actual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
intricacy of business could be obtained. At best only estimates
could be roughly arrived at by arbitrarily making
allowances and assumptions. Will those who talk about cost
of service reveal the formula by which they can accurately
calculate the cost of carriage of a particular article carried in
the same truck with a dozen others, all coming from different
places and destined for different stations over three or four
different lines, the cost of no two of which has been the
same, and the working expenses of which are totally dissimilar?
If they have discovered this formula, it remains
to be stated how it may be applied.</p>

<p>So serious are the difficulties in the way of ascertaining
the facts as to cost of transport, so varied are the circumstances
in this country, that it is not surprising that in every instance
in which the principle has been brought before a Parliamentary
Committee or Royal Commission it has met with
the condemnation expressed by the Select Committee of
1872&mdash;&#8220;it is impracticable.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p class="space-below1">If the use of each wagon were charged for,
according to its capacity, the cost of conveyance per truck could,
no doubt, be approximately known. Whether such a system is
the best for railway companies need not be here considered;
certain it is that it is extremely undesirable in the interest
of the trader. According to it, he must pay for a five or a
ten ton wagon, whether he filled it or not, and whether the
merchandise which he sent was silk, bales of cotton, or fruit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
The system of charging so much a wagon instead of so
much a ton&mdash;<i>wagenraum tarif</i>, as it is called&mdash;is, to a
considerable extent, in force in Germany and Holland. In both
these countries, however, it has been found incompatible
with the necessities of commerce to abide strictly by this
principle. One curious result would be brought about
by charging per wagon&mdash;there would be a return to
practices some forty years ago given up in England
as needlessly costly and unsuitable to business. Every
customer of a railway does not want a whole truck.
He wishes to send ten cwt. of bales or a cask weighing one
hundredweight; he could not send his goods if he had to pay
for a full truck. To provide for the wants of the great mass
of traders and the ordinary requirements of business, intermediaries
between the railway companies have sprung up in
Germany and Holland. Indeed, the great bulk of the traffic
in the latter country is carried by carriers or forwarding
agents in full wagon loads. The company is practically only
a toll taker. The forwarding agents charge the consignor or
consignee of the goods sums over and above the tolls or
rates paid to the companies. So far as a large part of the
public is concerned, the rates of the companies are, in those
countries, mere paper rates. Not being able to take a full
wagon, small traders must pay what the forwarding agents
demand, or make special terms with them. This is very much
the state of things which existed in England before 1844,
when the companies were, as a rule, merely owners of the road,
locomotives, &amp;c., and when they left to private persons the
business of carriers. Those who can recall that time, or who
reflect what the results of such a system would be, will scarcely
wish for its return; it would be indeed a lamentable
retrogression, injurious alike to the public and the railway
companies.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>

<h2>SECTION IV.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">EQUAL MILEAGE RATES.</span></h2>

<p>Another proposal which, though always condemned by
competent judges, is still, in some form, very often brought
forward, is to charge equal mileage rates.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Admitting the impossibility or impropriety of making rates vary according
to the cost of conveyance of goods without reference to their
value or quality&mdash;recognising the expediency of classification
in some form&mdash;many persons think that it would be well to
charge for the same kind of goods the same sum per mile
universally. This plan is simple; it has an appearance of
being equitable; and, as such, it is attractive. But, on the
slightest consideration, it becomes apparent that exceptions
which mar this simplicity must be admitted. In fact,
no one proposes that this principle should be inflexibly
carried out. Far from being really equitable, equal mileage
rates would often act most unfairly. Mileage run is only
one element out of many in cost of service; and to
compel companies to charge the same sum between points
equally distant, irrespective of the original cost of constructing
the way, the nature of the gradients, the amount and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
regularity of the traffic to and fro, and the extent of back
haulage of &#8220;empties,&#8221; would be doing great injustice.
Obviously an allowance must be made to cover the cost of
specially expensive undertakings, such as the Runcorn, Tay
and Forth Bridges, the Sol way Viaduct, or the Severn Tunnel.
So, too, allowance must be made for steep gradients; manifestly
the same paying load cannot be carried over gradients
of one in forty as over one in eight hundred. In Germany
and Holland an effort has been made to adopt the mileage
system; and (subject to exceptions for import, export and
transit rates, referred to afterwards) it is assumed to be
carried out. But patent facts could not be ignored; in
these countries an extra mileage up to 12 kilometres
(about 7&frac12; miles) is taken into the calculation of rates
for expensive bridges and steep gradients. Speed, too,
must be taken into account; as it increases, a more than
proportionate increase in engine power is necessary.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Equality is here not equity. To all railway companies
the result of establishing a system of equal mileage rates
would not be the same. Much would depend on the question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
whether the rates were the same over all parts of the same
railway, or whether equal mileage rates were in force
throughout the country: a distinction not always borne
in mind by those who propose such rates. Undoubtedly
to many railways the loss of traffic as the result, of
equal mileage rates would be serious. Unless a very
low scale of rates, entailing heavy and unnecessary loss,
were adopted, much of the long distance traffic would
cease to be carried. On other railways, however, the present
net revenue might be maintained by levelling up rates;
although the amount of traffic would be less, the working
expenses might be reduced. On the whole, the more the
theory of equal mileage rates is studied, the clearer it
becomes that its adoption would probably be much less
injurious to some railway companies than to colliery
proprietors, manufacturers, traders, ports, and to the country
at large.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>To consumers, whose interest are so apt to be lost sight of
in the controversy, the change would be disastrous. Equal
mileage rates would seriously lessen or even destroy traffic
now conveyed long distances. By narrowing the area of
supply, they would raise the prices of provisions and commodities
such as milk, fish, and vegetables in and near great
towns. The sustenance of a community such as London, is,
one might almost say, possible only because it is not fed
solely from the region immediately round it, but is supplied
from very distant points. If the London markets are able
to procure fish from remote parts of Scotland or Ireland,
beef from Aberdeenshire and adjacent counties, milk from
farms within 100 miles, vegetables from Penzance, and
the Channel Islands, eggs and butter from Normandy,
coals from the Midlands, Lancashire and South Wales, the
capital owes these advantages to the fact that English
railways have not been bound by equal mileage rates. Were
such a system strictly enforced, fuel, provisions, and most
of the necessaries of life would be raised in price. So far
as consumers are concerned, equal mileage freights by sea&mdash;the
height of absurdity in the eyes of all who know anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of commerce&mdash;would be as reasonable as equal mileage rates by land.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>To manufacturers whose works and premises are not
near densely populated districts or ports&mdash;the great centres
of consumption or export&mdash;the change would be disastrous.
They would be driven out of the field by more favourably
situated competitors, who would acquire a monopoly.
The pursuit of certain trades would become impossible in
districts in which they are now carried on with success.
Not a few manufactories would soon be closed, but for the
facilities which they now possess for procuring raw materials
from remote parts. To give a few illustrations out of many:
South Staffordshire is supplied with iron ore or pig-iron
from Staveley in Derbyshire, Westbury in Wiltshire, Fawler
in Oxfordshire, Frodingham in Lincolnshire, Ulverstone
and Wigan in Lancashire, Middlesborough in Yorkshire, and
also from South Wales; and it receives limestone from
Froghall in North Staffordshire, Minera in Denbighshire,
Wirksworth in Derbyshire, Presteign in Radnorshire, and
Porthywaen in Shropshire.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Such are examples of the interdependence of districts and industries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the co-operation of places far apart, with which equal mileage rates would
interfere. Even if originally they would have been beneficial
they would revolutionize the conditions under which trade
has been carried on in this country since the introduction
of railways.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Some advocates of the theory of mileage rates may
concede that their adoption would entail loss on certain
districts and to some individuals, but deny that the community
as a whole would suffer.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Is this a reasonable view? Even if the home trade were not injured,
the result of equal mileage rates must be to increase the cost of
production of many articles manufactured at a distance from ports
of shipment. Would not this make competition with foreign countries
more difficult than it is? And must it not reduce the
demand for labour?</p>

<p>The principle of equal mileage rates, it may be added,
has been condemned by every Royal Commission and Parliamentary
Committee which has investigated the subject; and
this condemnation has been pronounced on grounds for the
most part wholly independent of the interests of railway
companies. As pointed out by the Select Committee of 1872,
the principle would &#8220;prevent railway companies from making
perfectly fair arrangements for carrying at a lower rate than
usual goods brought in large and constant quantities, or for
carrying for long distances at a lower rate than for short
distances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would prevent railway companies from lowering their
fares and rates so as to compete with traffic by sea, by
canal, or by a shorter or otherwise cheaper railway, and
would thus deprive the public of the benefit of competition,
and the company of a legitimate source of profit.&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;It would compel a company to carry for the same rate
over a line which has been very expensive in construction
or which from gradients or otherwise is very expensive in
working, at the same rate at which it carries over less
expensive lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Committee add&mdash;&#8220;It will be found that the supporters
of equal mileage, when pressed, often really mean, not that
the rates they themselves pay are too high, but that the
rates which others pay are too low.&#8221; In other words, they
desire to apply the principle when it works in their favour,
and to reject it when it does not.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>SECTION V.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">DIFFERENTIAL RATES.</span></h2>

<p>While shrinking from advocating equal mileage rates,
many persons take up an intermediate position. They object
to rates being much out of proportion to distance; they do
so although the traffic may not be carried over the same
parts or sections of a railway. The rates to which objection
is taken are of several kinds:&mdash;Special rates for export traffic;
special rates for import traffic; transit or through rates;
special rates generally&mdash;special rates for long distance as
distinguished from short distance or intermediate traffic.</p>

<p>Such differential rates exist&mdash;and the circumstance is not
unimportant&mdash;in all countries in which railways have been
developed; and it will be found that, here as elsewhere, they
have been adopted, not solely or even chiefly with a view to
benefit railway companies, but mainly to meet the not
unreasonable demands of traders and consumers.</p>

<p>The following are a few instances of special import and
export rates charged by the railway companies in this
country, viz.:&mdash;

<p>In the abolition of these rates the home trader or
consumer can have no direct interest; although the transit
rate is lower than that for home traffic, it cannot in any way
prejudice the English trader. If the special rate were withdrawn
he would be no better off; the traffic would simply go
to its destination by water.</p>

<p>To reduced export rates the objections are few. They
are generally admitted to be useful; and at a time when on all
hands it is urged to be necessary to extend our trade abroad,
they could not be abolished without causing serious loss and
loud complaints. It is important to enable a colliery owner
to export coal, or a manufacturer without a port in the
vicinity of his works, to export his wares on such terms
that he will not be at a heavy disadvantage or be driven
out of the field. Special lower rates enable the manufacturers
of exported goods, such as manufactured cottons
from Manchester, and hardware from Birmingham, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
send them to London, and to avail themselves of lines of
steamers sailing from several ports. But for such facilities
exporters would be confined to one, and that the nearest,
port, and they would lose the benefit of the competition in
facilities and sea freights. The railway company which
happened to own the route to the nearest port would possess
a monopoly of the traffic, and might charge their full rates
instead of the present reduced rates.</p>

<p>Nor is the practice recently introduced in the interest of
railway companies. In the Act authorising the very
first railway on which steam was used, the Stockton and
Darlington, the principle is recognised. The tolls upon the
coal shipped on board any vessel for export were fixed at
one halfpenny per ton per mile, while the toll on all other
coal was 4d. per ton per mile. Each of the special export
rates has been made, it may be truly said, at the instance
of some manufacturer or shipper who would be injured by
their withdrawal. In granting such terms, railway companies
have endeavoured to satisfy the urgent demands of customers.
And if the rate to one intermediate place is fair and reasonable
in itself, is it any substantial grievance that it is higher
than the rate on goods for shipment?<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Special import rates have been much more attacked;
but when the principle is fairly carried out, they are no less
defensible than export rates. Most of the objections to them
come, it will be found, from persons who believe that they have
a vested interest in certain produce and trades; often they are
assailed by the very persons who are the defenders of reduced

export rates. The majority of special import rates naturally
arise out of sea competition. The existence of the import rates
for fresh meat and provisions from Liverpool and Bristol to
London, which have been especially condemned, is due, not,
as is assumed, to the arbitrary action of companies, but to
the demands and necessities of traders. Those who are interested
in the trade of Liverpool, the great seat of the
American trade, and in the steamers sailing between America
and Liverpool, desire to compete with the direct sea communication
with London, or with other ports near to it. In like
manner the shipping companies and others who are interested
in the trade of Southampton claim special rates and facilities in
favour of that port. Naturally they wish that a part of the
traffic should go <i>viâ</i> Southampton; and a compliance with
their wish benefits the public.</p>

<p>Special import rates are not charged on foreign goods
merely because they are foreign; the chief, though not the
only, explanation of their existence, is the desire of steamboat
companies and merchants that a part of the goods
consumed in other places may be carried through the port
in which they are interested, instead of the goods being all
sent through ports nearer to or direct to the ultimate
destination. The railways have, in fact, complied with
urgent local demands.</p>

<p>Some rates for import traffic are less than for the same
description of goods going in the opposite direction. Such
cases are probably rare, and the circumstances of all of them are
not fully known. The following, however, was the origin of
one of them: The millers in the Eastern counties found that
their trade suffered by reason of the competition of millers
situated on the Thames, who were able to obtain by water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
foreign grain at low rates. The former urged upon the railway
companies the necessity of granting them reduced rates from
London for foreign grain to mix with English wheat, and
thus enable them to produce better and stronger flour than
that produced by home grown wheat alone. The millers
pointed out that by so doing the local industries in which the
companies and the districts have an interest would be benefited,
and that there would be an increased trade in foreign
grain down from London and in flour up to it. Admitting
the force of these arguments, the railway companies put in
force lower rates. Here, as elsewhere, we find a collision
of interests, and conflicting demands. These rates have
recently been altered with the view of partially removing
the grounds of complaint in this case; it remains, however,
an apt illustration of the difficulties encountered in framing
rates. Reduced rates are complained of by one portion of the
public; and yet, if they were cancelled, other sections would
consider themselves aggrieved. Such are the difficulties
with which railway companies have to contend; bound to
serve and accommodate classes at variance with each other;
subject to criticism and complaint if they do not satisfy
contradictory demands.</p>

<p>There has been much hostile comment on the conveyance
at reduced rates of foreign produce and merchandise
from the Continent, through English ports to places of
consumption. The French traffic from Cherbourg or Havre
carried <i>viâ</i> Weymouth or Southampton, and from Boulogne
or Calais, <i>viâ</i> Dover or Folkestone, and the Dutch and
Belgian traffic from Rotterdam or Antwerp, <i>viâ</i> Harwich,
have been especially the subject of unfriendly remark. But
the explanation of such rates is simple; they are due to no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
designs against the English factor. French traffic carried
<i>viâ</i> Cherbourg may be sent direct by sea to London. In order
that it may be conveyed over a portion of their systems,
the London and South Western Company run steamers
between that port and Southampton; and until recently the
Great Western Company had a line of steamers between
Cherbourg and Weymouth. In order to compete with the
sea communication, the South Western and Great Western
Companies necessarily fixed their rates with reference to
the sea freights from Cherbourg and other ports. The
distance between Southampton and London is
76 miles, while the distance between Weymouth and London is
159 miles. Of course the Great Western Company charged
the same rates by the longer as the South Western Company
charged by the shorter railway route. Hence the complaint
that French goods were being carried cheaper from Cherbourg
to London than from places in Dorsetshire, past
which, when carried by the Great Western Company, they
were conveyed. The obvious answer was, that if the Great
Western Company did not carry at all, the traffic would be sent
<i>viâ</i> Southampton, and that if the London and South Western
Company ceased to carry, it would be sent to London direct
by sea. In fact, the Great Western Company have recently
given up the steamboat service, and ceased to carry <i>viâ</i>
Weymouth; the grounds of complaint made in the name of
the Dorsetshire farmers have thereby been removed. But
the competition, such as it is, of French with English
produce, continues all the same, only all the traffic is carried,
not through Dorsetshire, but by other routes. Indeed,
immediately after the service <i>viâ</i> Weymouth was withdrawn
a new service was established between Paimb&#339;uf and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Newhaven; and by this route a portion of the traffic
previously sent <i>viâ</i> Weymouth is now carried.</p>

<p>Irish produce from Waterford is carried to London by
various routes: direct to the latter by sea; by sea to Bristol,
and thence by rail, 119 miles to London; by sea to Milford, and
thence by rail, 282 miles; and by sea to Liverpool, and thence
by rail 201 miles. The rates <i>viâ</i> Bristol are, and must be, fixed
with reference to those charged by sea, and those <i>viâ</i> Milford
and <i>viâ</i> Liverpool, must be the same, or nearly so, as those
charged <i>viâ</i> Bristol. Yet, according to the views of some
persons, this competition is unfair to intermediate towns
between Milford and London, and between Liverpool and
London, between which intermediate places and London the
rates are higher, or higher in proportion, than those charged
between London and Waterford. There are complaints
as to this disparity, although the competition, if any
exists, would continue, even if no Irish traffic were carried
<i>viâ</i> Milford at all.</p>

<p>Similar observations apply to traffic between Dublin
and Liverpool. Between these cities there is daily steam
communication; so that goods carried by sea to Holyhead,
and thence by rail, may be conveyed throughout at
lower rates than those charged for traffic for places intermediate
between Liverpool and Holyhead. Indeed, sea
competition influences the rates for traffic between Dublin
and Manchester. Traffic is carried by sea, <i>viâ</i> Liverpool, and
thence by rail (31 miles) to Manchester, while the distance by
rail from the latter place to Holyhead is 122 miles.
Consequently the rates between Manchester and Dublin, <i>viâ</i>
Holyhead, are less than to some intermediate places.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Tea imported into London may be carried by sea direct to
Newcastle or Liverpool. Iron manufactured at Middlesboro&#8217;
or in South Wales can be conveyed by water at low freights
to London. So, too, tin-plates may be conveyed by water from
Glamorganshire to Liverpool. If the importer or the manufacturer,
therefore, desires to send, or the companies desire to
carry, any of those goods by railway, special rates yielding only
a small profit to the companies must be quoted; otherwise
the whole, or nearly the whole of such articles, would be sent
by sea. Such reduced rates are complained of because of
their being less in gross or per mile than those for the same
or similar articles carried for the like or less distances.
But grocers or consumers of tea, iron merchants or blacksmiths
in inland towns, or manufacturers whose works are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
near the port of shipment would derive no advantage from
all these goods being carried by sea at the same or even
lower rates than those now charged by railway. The influence
of the sea, &#8220;the great free trader&#8221; as it has been called,
is vast and far reaching. England and Scotland being an
island, there is all round the coast direct competition with
the sea. It exists for instance between London and Yarmouth,
Hull, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Leith, Aberdeen on the
eastern coast; and between London, Southampton and
Plymouth, and the west coast ports, that is, Bristol, the
South Wales ports, Liverpool and Glasgow.</p>

<p>If railways in England did not compete with transport
by the sea they would in many cases be of comparatively
little use to manufacturers and merchants. Only by such
competition do they fully minister to the requirements of
the trade of the country. If all the intermediate rates
were to be brought down to the level of those charged
between port and port what would be the result? The
companies would have to raise their port to port rates.
The public would lose the benefit of rail carriage for goods
sent between port and port, and the companies the profit they
might have derived from such goods. Who would be the gainer?<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Many apparent anomalies in railway rates arise from
competition of the railways with the sea: others are the
results of comparisons of the rates charged by railway companies,
which must carry, if they are to carry the traffic at
all, at the same rates as a company having a shorter route.
Inasmuch as competition between railway companies is
carried on extensively, many such disparities exist. The
apparent anomaly in tin plates being carried from South
Wales to Liverpool <i>viâ</i> Stockport, near Manchester, at lower
rates than to Manchester, was referred to by Mr. Johnson
Ferguson in the debate on the second reading of the Railway
and Canal Traffic Bill. This arises from the Midland
Railway Company competing with two shorter routes
between these places, and from the rates by those routes
being so fixed as to meet the competition by sea; the former
company&#8217;s longer route is through Stockport (not Manchester),
to which latter place of course there is no export
trade, and at which there is no sea competition. This
anomaly would be entirely removed by the Midland Company
ceasing to compete for the Liverpool traffic; but the
consumers of tin plates in Manchester would not in any
respect be benefited by the change. The distance by the
shortest railway route between London and Bristol is about
119 miles. There are two other railway routes, the shorter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of which is 161 miles; there is also direct transport by sea;
and by all of these routes there is competition for the conveyance
of merchandise traffic. To suit the requirements of
the trade between these ports, as well as to contend with competition
by water, special rates are charged. Withdraw them,
and either the interchange would not take place or the goods
would have to be sent by sea. Of course the other railway
companies carrying between the two places charge the
same rates as those in force by the shortest railway route,
otherwise they would obtain no share of the traffic; and
these rates are necessarily less for the throughout distance
than those charged for like descriptions of goods to some of
the intermediate towns on the longer route.</p>

<p>To take one more illustration: steamboats ply between
Liverpool and Bristol. Goods carried by railway between
these two places by one or other of the three available routes
must pass through some one of the following places:&mdash;Birmingham,
Worcester, Hereford, Shrewsbury, Chester or
Warrington. The local rates to all these intermediate towns
may appear disproportionate to those charged between
the extreme points. But is there any real injustice done? Is it
disadvantageous to the public that railway companies
should compete with sea carriage between different ports
in the Kingdom? Should not railway companies be
allowed to accept in respect of traffic so carried, which would
otherwise be wholly lost to them, a less percentage of profit
without being compelled to reduce all their rates to intermediate
inland places to the same or proportionately less
amounts? What injustice is done to those whoso goods are
carried to and from intermediate inland places by the fact
that their rates are higher, or higher in proportion, than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
competitive rates, provided the rates to intermediate places
are in themselves fair and within the Company&#8217;s legal maximum?</p>

<p>A third source of complaint of disproportionate rates arises
from the competition between ports. Assume, for instance,
port A to be 51 miles, port B 72 miles, and port C a greater
distance from D, one of the great seats of manufacture and
commerce. The merchants and shipowners at C and B
desire to compete with A, and they induce the railway company
to carry from all three at the same rates. The result is
that the rates are lower for the throughout distance than to
and from some of the intermediate places. The grounds of
grievance would be removed by the railway company ceasing
to carry from C and B at the same rates as from A. But
the importation of foreign goods would continue; the only
difference being that they would be carried through one
port instead of two or more. And here a curious fact may
be noted. If, in the case supposed, the railways between
A and D, B and D, and C and D belonged to separate
companies, in all probability no complaint would be made
of the rates from A, B, and C to D being the same. On
the contrary, competition being always desired by the public,
it would be considered in that case advantageous and in
the interest of the public. But because the lines between
B and D and C and D belong to the same company as that
between A and D complaints are made on account of the
rates being equal. What is hailed in the one case as a
benefit is decried in the other as mischievous and unjust.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief explanation of differential rates have been
mentioned; another cause less important is in operation. In
carriage by road, cost may be roughly measured by distance,
though even as to the expenses of cartage that is subject to
exceptions. But this test&mdash;admitted to be practically useless
as regards freight by sea&mdash;does not hold good of railway
transport. Of the various kinds of outlay on the part of a
railway company, a large portion remains fixed, whether the
distance run by a train is ten miles or one hundred. Such, for
example, are the cost of terminal accommodation, and the
services of loading and unloading, and clerical work. Such,
too, speaking broadly, are the interest on cost of construction,
repairs of bridges and earthworks, the permanent staff of
employés, and of signalling. Another kind of expenditure increases
directly with the mileage run; for example, the provision
of, and wear and tear of locomotives, rolling stock and
permanent way, and liability for loss of or damage to goods
in transit. Certain kinds of expenditure increase with the
distance run, but not in the same ratio. Obviously wages,
cost of locomotive power, and cost of haulage generally are
not four times as much in the case of a train which has run a
hundred miles as in one which has run twenty-five. With
the progress of railways, with improved economy in the use of
machinery, and in other ways, this tendency&mdash;recognised to
some extent by the Legislature in the rates for short distance
traffic&mdash;in expenditure not to increase in the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
proportion as mileage distance, becomes an important element.
The result of all this is to make mileage less a criterion of cost,
and tends to place large towns at a greater distance at an
advantage as compared with intermediate towns, and to give
rise to differential rates.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
It is also obvious that from many intermediate towns
the quantities forwarded are not so large
and regular as from terminal towns, and that from the
former there is not a constant traffic to and fro.</p>

<p>The urgent demands of traders and producers have
created differential rates; the interests of the public and
consumers have maintained them; interests, it may be added,
which have been little heard in any of the inquiries which
have taken place, but which, if any change were meditated,
would probably be found to have more at stake than the
railway companies. They would ask,&mdash;Why should such
special rates be withdrawn? They would be losers by the
change. The railway companies also would be losers. So
too would the public interested, especially as regards perishable
goods, in the more rapid and regular conveyance of
merchandise than is possible by water. Who would be the
gainer? Not, certainly, the home producer, who would find
foreign goods brought direct to London by sea; not the
consumer, who wishes cheap goods rapidly conveyed, and to
whom it is immaterial how they reach him. The fact is that
differential rates have arisen in no small degree out of the
same causes as have necessitated a classification of goods.
Goods of small intrinsic value will not be conveyed at all
unless at low rates; only on special terms can such goods
produced at a great distance be brought to market.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes it is urged as an objection to differential
rates, that by reason of them companies sustain, on long
distance traffic, a loss which is made up by charges on short
distance traffic. Repeated, as if it were an axiom, this
statement is generally erroneous; though producing, no
doubt, a lower percentage of profits than the latter, the former
yields some profit, unless where undue competition operates.</p>

<p>To carry traffic at a rate yielding a small profit, is better
for a railway company than to have its permanent way for
many hours unused, and its plant not fully employed. It may
be expedient to accept traffic producing only a small percentage
of profit, if it can be got on no better terms; such
traffic will at least help to defray the fixed charges, which
must be incurred whether it is carried or not. But is a
company bound to do all its business on such terms, or
would it be desirable that it should do so? Can the senders
of other traffic paying only reasonable rates, yielding the
company what would otherwise be admitted to be only a fair
profit, justly object? and if a company be deprived of this
long distance traffic, will it not be forced to raise rates on
other traffic in order to maintain its revenue?<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>But, it is also objected, differential rates deprive the inhabitants
of certain towns of the natural advantages of their
geographical position. This argument would be more persuasive
than it is if it were not generally expressed in the very
language of Protectionists, if it were not so often a claim of
an exclusive right to supply certain markets, and a scarcely
concealed dislike to the intrusion of competition. Even supposing
that low rates, which enable the produce of remote parts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of England and Scotland to be conveyed throughout the
length and breadth of the land may interfere with the trade of
manufacturers nearer London and other great towns; so
may the making of a railway. Places which have one, or
districts which are left without any, may be injured by railway
communication elsewhere being opened. The existence
of any such right as is claimed is questionable. Preserving
the natural advantages of one town means preventing
the removal of the natural disadvantages of others.
In truth, the abolition of differential rates would deprive
many places of their natural advantages. That Liverpool
is on the sea, and that Birmingham is not, that
there is sea communication from the former to London, are
circumstances which railways did not create, and to which
they must accommodate themselves. Railway Companies
are not answerable for the fact that certain kinds of traffic
come from a point having the advantage of a sea route;
that there is competition at one place and not at another;
and that goods may be conveyed from New York to London
all the way by sea, or partly by sea and partly by land.</p>

<p>If the rates for all traffic between intermediate places
were either made the same as or less than those to terminal
points, companies would be compelled to consider
whether raising the export and import rates, or
reducing those on local traffic, would result in the least
loss. If the former course were adopted, as, in the majority
of cases it would be, the facilities which manufacturers and
merchants now enjoy would be withdrawn; it would be
to their interest to ship at the nearest port. The railways
would suffer some loss. The inhabitants of intermediate
places and the port towns would derive no advantage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
except the removal of what generally is merely a sentimental
grievance. What would a London draper gain if
the Manchester and London Shipping rate were withdrawn,
and if manufacturers shipped all their goods in Liverpool
instead of a portion of them being shipped from London?
What would it avail an Essex farmer if Dutch and Belgian
produce were sent direct from Rotterdam and Antwerp to
London, instead of through Harwich? Would farmers
in the South of England be any better off if French
eggs and butter were sent by sea to London instead of
through Southampton or Newhaven?

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>SECTION VI.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">GROUPING HERE AND ON THE CONTINENT.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Grouping,&#8221; is the name of the familiar arrangement by
which collieries or works within a given area are charged
equal rates, and are thus enabled to compete on equal terms.
In fixing the rates for traffic carried long distances, grouping
stations far apart is carried out to some extent. For
instance, the rates for tin plates from South Wales and
Monmouthshire to Liverpool are the same from the works
between Carmarthen on the west, and Monmouth on the
east, the distances varying from 160 to 206 miles. So, too,
the rates between Scotland and places in England, south
of and inclusive of Yorkshire, are divided into groups&mdash;22
in the former, and 39 in the latter. Though the
practice is not of the first importance to railway companies,
it is not without value to them. If &#8220;grouping&#8221; were prohibited,
and the nearest collieries or works could supply
all the coal or goods which were required, railway
companies might, in some cases, earn as much net profit
on the traffic carried as if grouping were adopted. No doubt,
however, if the nearest collieries or works charged the public
enhanced prices, or if they could not supply the commodities
to the extent required by the public, the railway companies
would suffer. They would lose not only the traffic which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
might have carried, but they would also suffer from the
lessened prosperity of districts in which they had an indirect
as well as a direct interest.</p>

<p>The chief sufferers, however, from the giving up of
&#8220;grouping&#8221; would be the public; they distinctly gain by the
practice, though producers near great towns or sea-ports may
lose the benefit of &#8220;geographical position.&#8221; Collieries and
works which are &#8220;grouped&#8221; are enabled to contribute to
the available supply. They enter markets from which they
would be otherwise shut out; the extent of the trade is
thereby increased; the price paid by the consumer may be
lessened. In fact, many traders admit, tacitly at least, the
value of the practice.</p>

<p>Its legality has lately been called in question. It has
been supposed to be prohibited by the decision of the Railway
Commissioners in the case of the <i>Denaby Main Colliery
Company</i> v. <i>Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway
Company</i>, which came before them in January, 1880.
The complaint was that the rates and tolls charged to
the owners of the Denaby Main Colliery, for the conveyance
of coal, both by railway and canal were an undue
prejudice and disadvantage to themselves and undue preference
to the others within the meaning of Section 2 of
the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1854. The railway
rates from the Denaby Main Colliery to Keadby, which is
25 miles, and to Grimsby, which is 56 miles, were 2s. 1½d.
and 3s. 1d. per ton respectively. Similar rates were charged
from the other collieries in the same group, although the
distances between Keadby and Grimsby and the Denaby
Main Colliery were 15 miles less than the most distant of
the other collieries in the group. For all coal passing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
certain places to the eastward, the Denaby Main Colliery
was grouped with 48 other collieries in the same district.
But, except in certain cases, the collieries were not grouped
for coal going to the west; on traffic sent to places in that
direction Denaby had to pay according to its geographical
position. With regard to some portion of their traffic to
the west, the Denaby Main Colliery had special rates. The
decision of the Railway Commissioners, which has not been
reversed, was that this particular grouping system did subject
the proprietors of the Denaby Main Colliery to undue and
unreasonable prejudice and disadvantage. But their decision
was probably upon the facts, not upon the law; and their
finding really was that the group was too large, and that
the Denaby Main Colliery ought to be taken out of it. The
same question was to some extent discussed in the House of
Lords in the <i>Denaby Main Colliery Company Limited</i> v.
<i>Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Company</i>
(L.R. 11, A.C. p. 97); and the observations of the learned
law lords do not confirm the opinion that grouping is <i>per
se</i> illegal.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
If the contrary were the case&mdash;if all such arrangements
were necessarily illegal&mdash;the result would be somewhat
serious to trade.</p>

<p>A few particulars as to grouping on the Continent may
be mentioned. It will be found that it has been adopted
there for the same reasons as led to it here.</p>

<p>In Germany and Holland grouping is recognised.
There, as has been previously mentioned, mileage rates is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the principle on which the tariffs are based, and the State
practically controls the rates. But some exceptional tariffs
for coal and coke are not calculated upon the distance
from the place of origin to the station of destination.
Sending stations in certain cases, and sea-ports in others, are
formed into groups. In Germany, for instance, the sending
stations included in the exceptional tariff with Bremen,
Hamburg, and other ports in the North of Germany, are
divided into seven groups. The first three embrace all
the stations in the Right Rhenish district where coal
mines exist. Group 1 contains about fifteen stations from 6
to 24 kilometres distant from each other, in a total distance
of 245 kilometres to Bremen and 359 kilometres to Hamburg.
Group 2 contains about thirty-five stations from 1 to 19 kilometres
distant, and Group 3 seven stations at distances varying
from 1 to 13 kilometres. The total distances to Bremen and
Hamburg are 271 and 385 kilometres respectively. For all
stations in the same group there is one tariff, which is for
one fixed consignment per week:&mdash;</p>

<p>The coal stations of the Rhine Province and
Westphalia are also grouped for Dutch, Belgian and French
traffic. In the two last cases, however, the differences of
distance are very slight. For Dutch traffic the differences
of distance between the stations in Group 1 vary from 1 to
16 kilometres in a total distance of 218 kilometres, in
Group 2 from 3 to 20 in a total distance of 233 kilometres,
and in Group 3 from 1 to 33 in 265 kilometres.</p>

<p>The grouping of the ports in the North of Germany,
shows a much greater difference in favour of certain ports.
For instance, the same rates are charged from the coal
stations to Bremen as to Hamburg, although the former is
114 kilometres (71 miles) further; the distance from Dortmund
to Bremen being 237 kilometres (147 miles), and to
Hamburg 351 kilometres (218 miles.) The same rates are
also charged to the following ports as to Bremen, which is
distant from the various coal stations from 221 to 271 kilometres:&mdash;</p>

<h2>SECTION VII.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">DIFFERENTIAL RATES ON THE CONTINENT.</span></h2>

<p>In France, Belgium, and Germany, there are fewer ports
competing with railways or with each other than in Great
Britain. In each of those countries the principle of mileage
rates has been nominally, and, to a large extent, in practice
adopted. But in all of them causes similar to those which
have here created so-called differential rates have been in
operation. In each of them the fact of competition by water
is recognised as a reason for charging reduced or special
rates; such rates for export or import traffic exist, although
the special rates for the latter traffic are fewer than for the
former; and there are also special transit rates<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.
All these rates have been established after much consideration.
Writing of the discussion of the subject in the Corps Legislatif
in 1863, M. Aucoc observes in his well-known work, &#8220;Since
that solemn discussion, the principle of differential tariffs has
been placed beyond question.&#8221; He adds: &#8220;It may be well
to mention also that, in the numerous judicial works on the
working of railways, not only the legality, but the necessity
and equity of conditional and differential rates have been
almost unanimously recognised.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Take first the special rates in France. Wheat may be
imported either <i>viâ</i> Marseilles, or <i>viâ</i> Rouen and the
Seine to Paris, the distance from Marseilles being 863 kilometres,
and from Rouen 134 kilometres. To compete with the sea and the
Rouen route, the Paris, Lyons, and Mediterranean Railway
Company charges for imported goods, special rates between
Marseilles and Paris. These rates have been complained
of as encouraging foreign trade. The answer, however, is
that if not conveyed <i>viâ</i> Marseilles such goods might be
conveyed <i>viâ</i> Rouen and the Seine to Paris. The general
tariff rates on the French lines are based upon a uniform
charge per kilometre, irrespective of any special requirements
of the locality. In order, however, to remedy the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
disadvantages arising from such a system, and to meet
the various circumstances and requirements of particular
trades, numerous special tariffs are adopted with the sanction
of the Minister of Public Works. These special rates are not,
as is sometimes supposed, fixed upon any regular or uniform
basis. Some are adopted for the purpose of developing a new,
or increasing an existing trade which may be subjected to
competition from other districts; others are established
to meet competition by sea, canal, or otherwise. Under
some circumstances reduced rates are arrived at by adopting
computed instead of actual distances; the former being
sometimes based on the distance by a shorter route either by
rail, road or sea. But in some cases an arbitrary distance is adopted.</p>

<p class="space-below1">The French railway companies have special import
and export rates for numerous articles in their classifications
which are lower than the ordinary class rates to the port
town, and occasionally lower than the class rates from intermediate
stations; in which case the special import and
export rates may apply. The following table is a comparison
of a few import and export rates with the ordinary class rates.
The latter, it should be observed, are, in some instances,
based on computed, and not on actual, distances.

<p>The rate for Yarn from Dieppe to Bâle, a distance of 716
Kilometres, is 47 frs. 30 cts. The explanation of these
apparent anomalies is that the rates from Roubaix and Rouen
to Epinal are based on the local ordinary tariffs; that the rate
from Antwerp to Epinal is a special import rate; whereas the
rate from Dieppe to Bâle is a still lower special tariff for transit

In respect of traffic for intermediate places, the French
railway companies may make higher charges than the rates
for <i>transit</i> traffic carried over the same portion of railway
beyond those places. But they may be required to charge
the same sums for traffic to or from any intermediate place
as they charge for import or for export traffic carried beyond.</p>

<p>In Belgium, also, differential rates are charged between
certain places for export and for local consumption. The

<p class="space-above1">Neither private companies nor the State railways
are permitted to make concessions of any kind, or to depart from
the official tariff in favour of any particular firm or carrier.
All general or special tariffs must be approved by the
Minister, and published in the official paper, the &#8220;Moniteur.&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>On the Prussian railways the maximum rates shewn in
the tariff are actually charged. But exceptions are made
where trade requirements, competition, and other similar
circumstances appear to necessitate a departure from the
official rates. It is not considered that railway companies are,
in general, bound to adjust anomalies in the carriage charged
for traffic arising in different districts, for one and the same
destination, by reducing the rates from the more distant
sending station. But for the sake of uniformity the rates are
so adjusted if, for any reason, exceptional rates from any
particular district have been adopted, and if they are
lower than from intermediate stations nearer by rail to the
same destination.</p>

<p>In Germany under the &#8220;<i>Seehafen Ausnahme Tarif</i>,&#8221;
there are a very considerable number of special rates. For
instance, the rate for grain from Bremen to Cologne, a
distance of 324 kilometres, is 12 marks, while from Hemelingen,
which is short of Bremen by six kilometres, to Cologne
(318 kilometres) it is 15 marks 50 pfenning. For the
purpose of stimulating the traffic from the Rheinisch Westfälischen
District with the German North Sea Ports, viz.,
Emden, Leer, Papenburg, Bremen, Bremerhaven, the competition
of the rates to the Dutch ports, to which the
Rhine affords a cheap water conveyance, had to be taken
into consideration. Accordingly from Essen to Bremen,
254 kilometres, the Amsterdam rates, which are lower than
the tariff rates from Dortmund to Bremen, 237 kilometres,
were adopted, although the traffic from Essen to Bremen has
to pass <i>viâ</i> Dortmund, which is 17 kilometres nearer to
destination. In another instance the German State railways
give a rebate of 5 marks per truckload for coal exported from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Hamburg.&mdash;&#8220;For consignments of coal for Hamburg and
Harburg a <i>rebate</i> of 5 marks per 10,000 kilos. is made
when proof is given that the coal is destined for export to
Trannaine, places outside of Germany or for the German
Baltic Ports.&#8221; In other words, a rate of 5 marks less is
charged to Hamburg for coal for export than to the same
place for coal to be consumed in the town.</p>

<p>Exceptional Tariff No. 2 consists of special rates for
goods traffic between stations of the Royal Elizabeth
Railway, &amp;c., and Gustavsburg. They, however, are only in
force during the period when vessels can ply on the Rhine,
for instance:&mdash;For &#8220;Stückgut&#8221; or piece goods from
Vienna to Gustavsburg the transit rate is 7m. 24pf. per 100 kilos.
1st class, and 6m. 60pf. 2nd class, and the local rates are
8m. 11pf. 1st class, and 7m. 73pf. 2nd class.</p>

<p>The effect of these special rates is to secure the traffic
to the Bavarian State and Hessian railways, and prevent
its passing over the Prussian and Dutch railways. The
Rheinisch Westfälischen private railways grant contract
(Abonnements Special Train) tariffs for the conveyance
of coal from the Ruhr district to Nederlandish
stations in fixed consignments of at least 200 tons, and not
exceeding 300 tons. The adoption of these rates has principally
been prompted by the competition of the water
service on the Rhine. They include haulage to the sidings
or depôts; and they are granted only to traders who contract
to send at least once a week for one year a consignment of
from 200 to 300 tons to Nederlandish stations.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that in Germany the carriage of
traffic in large quantities is charged at special or reduced
rates. A similar principle has been recognised in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
country also. It was held by the Court of Common
Pleas, in the case of Nicholson <i>v.</i> Gt. Western, that &#8220;Clause
31 of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 17 and 18 Vic.,
is not contravened by a railway company agreeing to
carry at a lower rate, in consideration of a guarantee of
large quantities and full loads at regular periods provided
that the real object of the railway company be to obtain
thereby a greater remunerative profit by the diminished
cost of carriage, although the effect may be to exclude
from the lower rate those persons who cannot give such a
guarantee.&#8221; The effect of such a system, however, has been
complained of by smaller traders as favouring the larger ones;
and in this country, it is not in practice generally acted upon.</p>

<p>The basis of through tariffs between Germany and other
foreign countries is the normal mileage rate to the German
frontier; but with the view of encouraging the export
trades, reduced rates are charged in favour of international
traffic.</p>

<p>The Dutch are also desirous of developing their transit
traffic; and with that object so called &#8220;exceptional rates,&#8221;
based upon lower mileage rates than the ordinary tariffs,
are charged from places of production in Germany to the
Dutch ports. Thus, there are &#8220;exceptional rates&#8221; for,
amongst other things, heavy iron and steel goods from
manufacturing towns in Westphalia to Amsterdam and
Rotterdam, and they are as much as 37 per cent. lower than
the ordinary rates. These German-Dutch rates are invariably
lower than the ordinary rates to inland towns lying between
the forwarding station and the port. The following are
some of the exceptional rates in force, compared with the
ordinary rates to inland towns for shorter distances:&mdash;

the local rate being m. 51·60 per ton; for wool
from Buda Pesth to Amsterdam the rate per ton of 1,000

kilogrammes in lots of 5 tons, is export m. 67·0, local
m. 81·30. These rates are only available for goods destined
for export or import; and, as will be seen, they are considerably
lower than the rates for the same description of
goods for consumers in the port of shipment. There
are also exceptional rates for goods traversing Germany
to and from the German sea-ports and Austria and Hungary.

<p class="space-above1">In Holland no scale of rates is universally
chargeable. Each railway company is authorised by the Concession
under which the railway was constructed, to
charge certain specified rates. But, as in England, the
existing rates actually charged are generally lower than the
maximum; and the fixing of them maybe controlled by the
State. By Article 31 of the Dutch Law the railway companies
are required to carry all goods (not excluded from transport)
and passengers at the rates set forth in the published
tariffs, and under the conditions determined by the
regulations, without unduly favouring special persons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Societies, Companies, or other bodies. By the existing law
the railway companies are forbidden to make special
arrangements for carriage at lower rates than those published
in the tariffs, except in the following cases:&mdash;</p>

<p class="no-indent">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(<i>a</i>). For the carriage of large quantities;<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(<i>b</i>). For the carriage of one or more truckloads of goods at stated intervals;<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(<i>c</i>). For the carriage of goods intended for charitable purposes or for exhibition.</p>

<p>Notice of such exceptions has to be given to the Home
Minister. Those reductions must be available for all goods
of the same class, to be conveyed on the same line, and under
the same conditions; they must be immediately advertised;
and they remain in force during the existence of the contract.</p>

<p>By the strict letter of the law it is provided that the same
rates must, over the whole of the system of the railway, be
charged by the company for the like article for the same
distance. But, in consequence of the competition by
inland navigation for traffic to and from places in Holland,
and also by the Rhine, and through Belgium for German
traffic, this requirement proved impossible to carry out in
practice. The Government have found it necessary to
allow the companies to enter into special contracts for
the conveyance of goods on such conditions as they might
consider it desirable to agree upon. Notice of any special
contract must, as before stated, be given to the Minister of
Commerce after it is entered into, and the official assent is
subject to the company agreeing to enter into a like agreement
with any other person. While such is the letter of
the law, virtually enjoining equal mileage rates, the practice
is altogether different. For any description of traffic, special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
agreements as to quantity to be forwarded and time of
delivery are made. The great object is to obtain traffic.
The published notices of such contracts contain, it may be
added, no information which can be utilized.</p>

<p>In Italy, differential rates have been the subject of
public inquiry, and the representatives of some local interests
have asked for their abolition. But they exist; and the verdict
upon them of the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry in
1881 was: &#8220;It is indisputable that the system of differential
rates has helped to strengthen and improve the national
industries.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The fact of railways in other countries charging special
rates for import, export and transit traffic, is, of course, not
a proof of their being right in principle. But the foregoing
information may correct loose assertions or suggestions that
differential rates are unknown or rare elsewhere. It shows
that the railway authorities and the Governments who control
the rates in those countries, even while professing to charge
mileage rates, have considered it necessary, with the view of
promoting and protecting the interests of their trade, to
charge differential rates.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>In the United States, where there is much competition
for the conveyance of long distance interstate traffic, and
where remarkably low rates&mdash;&#8220;war rates,&#8221; as they are
called&mdash;are charged, charges for intermediate traffic are not
lowered proportionately. In that country differential rates
have been much attacked; they have no doubt occasionally
been imposed without measure or reason. But they still
subsist, and are found useful. As an illustration it may be
stated that, at the present time, the rates for the conveyance
of flour from Minneapolis to Milwaukee, 335 miles, and to
Chicago, 420 miles, are the same; while the rate to Duluth,
164 miles, is only 25 per cent. less.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>SECTION VIII.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">THE INTEREST OF CONSUMERS IN RATES.</span></h2>

<p>Of the causes which have prevented progress in the
public discussion of rates, chief has been the fact that the
subject has been regarded too exclusively from the point of
view of a limited number of traders or producers. The general
interests of the country have been overlooked, or it has been
assumed that they are identical with those of particular
traders. Once the question is looked at from several
sides&mdash;as it appears to those who buy as well as to those
who sell, and to producers in different places&mdash;many of the
complaints made against the companies as to the existing
system of fixing rates are seen to be unfounded.</p>

<p>Those who buy commodities are interested in getting
them to the various markets cheaply and in abundance.
They wish the charge for transport to be small&mdash;they wish it
to be small even if the distance from which the goods are
conveyed be great, because their sources of supply are thereby
increased. To the consumer the ideally perfect state of things
would be a tariff for the conveyance of merchandise based on
the same principle as the Penny Post; commodities would be
conveyed at a low price, and producers over an immense area
would be able to send them to market. To the consumer it
would be in every way desirable that all disadvantages of
distance or &#8220;geographical advantages&#8221; should disappear.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Accordingly, as has been before stated, plans have been
brought forward for making uniform rates for the same class
of goods within a large area, or within certain regions or
zones. The attainment of this is impracticable&mdash;the distance
between various parts of the same country cannot be ignored,
as in the case of carrying letters or transmitting telegrams.
Consumers may fairly desire that the cost of transporting
articles from a great distance may be lowered so as to
permit of the influx of goods from remote parts. But unfortunately
they cannot altogether efface distance. The next
best thing is that the cost of transport shall not increase
<i>pro rata</i> with the distance. This reasonable desire railway
companies have sought to satisfy, and with what results is
well known.</p>

<p>London, for instance, formerly drew its chief supplies
of food from its immediate neighbourhoods. The extensive
market gardens which existed, especially in the eastern
and western suburbs, sent their produce to town by heavy road
wagons, and to this day they continue to do so. But as population
increased, and the demand for food became greater, the
facilities, both in regard to conveyance and charges, afforded
by the railway companies, enabled farmers, graziers, and
market gardeners in distant parts of the kingdom to compete
with those in the immediate neighbourhood of London, to the
obvious advantage of the consumer. In this way fat cattle
from Norfolk, meat from Scotland and Devonshire, fish from
Scotland, Ireland, and the East and West Coast of England,
broccoli and new potatoes from the Scilly Islands, Penzance
and the Channel Islands, store potatoes from Lincolnshire
and Scotland, and other articles of food are conveyed by the
railway companies at rates which, although not proportionate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
to those charged for shorter distances, are beneficial
to traders and their customers. Meat is carried from Yorkshire,
about 189 miles, at 55s. per ton; from Aberdeen, 516
miles, at 67s. 6d.; and from Stromness, in Orkney, 776 miles,
at 90s. per ton. Potatoes from Yorkshire are carried at 15s.;
from Sunderland, 269 miles, 18s. 4d.; and from Aberdeen,
30s. per ton. The effect is to open fresh markets to
producers throughout the country, and to supply the wants
of an ever increasing population at such reasonable prices
as would not otherwise be possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;To move is practically to produce,&#8221; at least it often
is so. The consumer desires that commodities and materials should
be conveyed from places where they are produced cheaply or
are abundant, to places where they are more in demand; that
coal, for instance, should go to districts where there is ore
without fuel available for smelting; that timber, or excellent
building stone, should be conveyed to great cities; and
that the small value of many raw materials, rendering it
impossible for them to bear more than the lowest rate of
carriage, should not prevent their being conveyed. This
demand, also, the railway companies have satisfied by charging
rates not always exactly varying with the distance.
Writing of the marvellous effects of railways, the late
Mr. Newmarch, in his edition of &#8220;Tooke&#8217;s History of
Prices,&#8221; says: &#8220;Among their greatest achievements are the
opening up of new fields of supply, and the deepening of old
channels of consumption. They have brought into profitable
use mines, forests, quarries, arable and grazing
districts, fisheries, harbours, and rivers, previously inaccessible.
The produce arising from these various and numerous
sources is so much additional wealth placed at the command
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of the community.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Had equal mileage rates been universally enforced many of those
new sources of supply would still be useless; the articles would
not bear the cost of transport.</p>

<p>At any given time in a particular market there is a certain
price which an article such as milk, wheat, or iron will
fetch. Assuming that price to be 30s., the cost of production
20s., the rate of conveyance 3d. a mile, A, B, C, D, to
be four places, each 10 miles distant from each other on
the same railway, and each capable of producing an &#8220;output&#8221;
of 500 tons. The article can be economically conveyed
no further than (10 x 12) / 3 = 40 miles, that is from D.
In such circumstances consumers will have an available
supply of 2,000 tons. Producers at A, 10 miles distant,
will pay for transport 2s. 6d.; those at B, 5s., and so
on. Those at A, B, and C, 10, 20, 30 miles distant,
will possess a considerable advantage over producers at
D, the place 40 miles distant. This superiority would
be retained by those who have long leases; but in course
of time, by the action of competition, rents would rise, and
the advantage would tend to pass to the owners of the
land at A, B and C. What would be the result, if a
railway company, desirous of enlarging its traffic, established
lower rates (say 2d. a mile) to E and F, places on the
same line, also 10 miles apart, and equally capable of producing
an &#8220;output&#8221; of 500 tons? The particular article
might now be conveyed from F, 60 miles distant. The consumer
would benefit; his available supply would now be
3,000 tons. In practice this might be an understatement of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the gain to him, for the result might be to give access to
districts in which the conditions of production were altogether
easier and cheaper. Producers at A, B and C, might temporarily&mdash;the
landowners at these points might permanently&mdash;suffer;
but the public and other landowners would gain.
They would gain indirectly and directly&mdash;directly in the
increased volume of supply, indirectly by the increase of
traffic enabling the company to keep down its general scale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
of charges; and manufacturers and landowners at points E
and F would benefit. Such an illustration may serve to
show how the interests of some landowners and certain
traders may sometimes be on one side, and those of consumers,
other landowners, the bulk of traders, and the
railway companies on the other.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>

<h2>SECTION IX.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">THE REAL BASIS OF RATES.</span></h2>

<p>The Managers of English railways have not assumed
that they could fix rates on a &#8220;Scientific&#8221; or &#8220;Natural&#8221;
basis. But they have endeavoured, after consulting merchants,
manufacturers and traders, to fix such rates as were
required to develop the largest amount of trade; and it is
submitted that they have been carrying out principles which
will, on the whole, bear the closest examination. They probably
have made mistakes, and in some cases entered into
undue competition with each other, or fostered it too much
between producers or ports. But the principles upon which
they have acted are sound; and the instances in which they
have erred are exceptional. It has been the aim of railway
companies to make rates conform to the requirements of
trade, or, according to a popular expression, to charge what
the traffic will bear.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
 It is easy to misrepresent this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
principle. The commonest misrepresentation is to assume that
it means charging what the traffic will <i>not</i> bear. Rightly
understood, this, it is contended, is the only fair working
principle; the only scientific rule, if that phrase has any
clear meaning. It is only another way of saying that
rates should be so fixed as to enable a manufacturer or a
trader and the railway company to obtain a reasonable
profit, and that rates should ultimately be determined by
the law of supply and demand. The value of conveyance,
like the value of any other service, is not necessarily what it
costs, but what it is worth to him who wishes his goods
carried. On supply and demand, the available means of
transport and the demand for it depends what it is
worth while to give for carrying an article from A to B.
Obviously the demand will be affected by the nature of the
merchandise. If it be of a costly nature, such as manufactured
articles, producers of it or dealers in it can afford to pay
a higher rate than if it were of low value; a rate of 3d. a
ton per mile, which might be prohibitive of the carriage
of sand or lime, would add to the value of silk or velvet
only an insignificant percentage.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The capital of English railways amounts to upwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of £800,000,000. One of the problems to be considered
is how to raise a revenue sufficient to pay on this sum
even a moderate rate of interest? The Companies might
perhaps obtain it by charging for conveyance according
to equal mileage rates or according to cost of service.
Following such a course they might probably levy charges
which a great portion of the traffic would not bear; they
might charge, for example, as much for a consignment of pig
iron as for a consignment of copper of equal weight carried
equal distances&mdash;which is generally what cost of service
implies. If their sole object were to obtain the necessary
revenue, they might cease to regard the effect of rates upon the
interests of traders, districts, or ports, and, while conforming
to the statutory maximum, they might levy rates detrimental
to particular kinds of traffic. Their practice has been altogether
different: they have sought to give full effect to the intention
which Parliament had in view in framing the rude statutory
classifications. They have endeavoured to suit the charges
to the capacity of the traders, and in the words of Section 90
of the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act of 1845, &#8220;To accommodate
them (the rates) to the circumstances of the traffic.&#8221;
Such is the only sound principle working to the interest alike
of railways and their customers. If rates were too high, and
the traffic could not bear them, traders would suffer; the
companies themselves would also suffer; their traffic would
diminish, or would not expand as it might do. Such was the
principle, speaking generally, on which the classification in
railway Acts was framed. Such, too, is the principle of
existing rates, only instead of being an hypothesis as to what
will suit particular kinds of traffic, the existing classification
and rates are based on facts carefully ascertained, verified by
long experience, and corrected from time to time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not unimportant to bear in mind that much the
same principle as that which we have discussed is applied
in regard to indirect taxation, or the taxation of commodities.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
What an article will bear&mdash;in other words what the
owner can with convenience pay&mdash;is a rule alike applicable
to taxation and railway rates. In more civilised countries
articles of prime necessity are not taxed, or very little;
articles of luxury and of great value are taxed more. A
distinction is made between wheat and tobacco, sugar and
wine; and whenever it is practicable, without opening the
door to fraud, to put indirect taxes on <i>ad valorem</i> basis,
it is done. A similar rule is observed, so far as possible, with
respect to direct taxation. Income tax, for example, is
payable only by those whose incomes exceed £150. An
endeavour is made to obtain the revenue of the country from
the persons who can best afford to pay, and to levy it upon
articles, the taxation of which will, to the least practicable
extent, be a burden on the trade of the country. To fix
railway rates on any other principle than that described
above would be much like raising the national revenue from
all persons alike, rich or poor, to impose the Customs and
Excise upon all commodities, whether articles of luxury or
necessity, and irrespective of their value.</p>

<p>When railways were first authorised, it was everywhere
anticipated, strange though it may now appear, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
the companies would be merely toll takers, and that the
public, or carriers, would use them in the same manner as
turnpike roads. Every railway was to be a highway; every
one of the King or Queen&#8217;s subjects was to be free to use it.
Many statutes bear traces of this, now apparently, curious
assumption. The private Acts, as a rule, contained no provision
for the companies themselves acting as carriers. The
classification of the articles to be carried and the tolls to be
taken were borrowed from the canal Acts. No very clear
principle of classification ran through the special Acts. The
classification in the main, however, probably accorded with
the considerations pointed out by Adam Smith, who drew
attention to the inconvenience of levying tolls on turnpike
roads solely according to weight.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Speaking broadly, the
tolls were in accordance with the ideas as to indirect taxation
prevalent at the time when canals began to be largely constructed.
In the original classification one may trace a desire
to encourage agriculture, and the manufacture of iron, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
such articles as were, generally speaking, carried in large
quantities. Articles of general use in manufactures and
raw materials were to be carried cheaply. The omissions
from the lists of articles are remarkable. Such commodities
as coal, iron ore, bricks, clay, manure, slates, stone,
bar and pig iron, heavy iron castings, anvils, chains, timber,
grain, flour, sugar, hides, dye-woods, earthenware, drugs,
cotton and wool, were enumerated. On the other hand,
machinery, hardware, hollow-ware, cutlery, glass, ale, wines
and spirits, grease, oils, soap, drysalteries, paints, colours,
paper, leather, floor-cloth, and textile fabrics, were
not named; they came under the general description of
&#8220;manufactured goods, articles, matters or things,&#8221;
and might be charged the highest maximum rates. The special
Acts contained, as a rule, an enumeration of only 40 to 50
articles in three to five classes.</p>

<p>In a few years, experience proved that the theories on
which Parliament had proceeded were impracticable. In the
first place, the notion that railways could be used by all
comers in much the same way as canals or roads was found
to be erroneous. Railway companies accordingly applied,
in their special Acts, for powers not only to find locomotive
power and wagons, but also to convey traffic as common
carriers. In 1845, the Railways Clauses Act (s. 86) authorised
every company to convey on their railway all such
passengers and goods as might be offered to them for that
purpose, and to make such reasonable charges in respect
thereof as might be from time to time determined upon, not
exceeding the tolls by the special Act authorised to be taken.
The special Acts contained, as has been stated, imperfect
classifications of merchandise, the maximum rates chargeable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
for conveyance, and powers to charge for loading, unloading,
and other services incidental to the business of a
carrier. About 1845 a second great change in the mode
of charging for conveyance came to pass; and it is a
circumstance worth noting that about that date a similar
change took place, without concert, in France, Belgium and
wherever railways existed. Up to that time railways had,
as a rule, acted on the principle of equal mileage rates.
This proved disadvantageous; it did not meet the requirements
of trade; it was particularly unsatisfactory to distant
traders; it prevented the opening up of new districts;
and it needlessly limited the amount of traffic.</p>

<p>About the time which we have mentioned, the imperfection
of the statutory classifications became manifest. Such
rates as were intended to be <i>ad valorem</i> were not in fact on
that basis; so far as it was intended to favour raw produce this
object was not sufficiently accomplished. The advantages of
differential rates, the necessity of adapting charges to the
traffic, the power of railways to open up new districts, and
develop new industries, began to be understood. Accordingly
the Legislature enacted the following provision, the words
of which merit attention:<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>S. 90, &#8220;And whereas it is expedient that the company
should be enabled to vary the tolls upon the railway
so as to <i>accommodate them to the circumstances of the
traffic</i>, but that such power of varying should not be
used for the purpose of prejudicing or favouring particular
parties, or for the purpose of collusively and
unfairly creating a monopoly either in the hands of
the company or of particular parties, it shall be lawful,
therefore, for the company, subject to the provisions
and limitations hereinafter and in the special
Acts contained, <i>from time to time to alter or vary the
tolls by the special Act authorised to be taken, either upon
the whole or upon any particular portion of the railway
as they shall think fit</i>; provided that all such tolls be
at all times charged equally to all persons, and after
the same rate, whether per ton, per mile or otherwise,
in respect of all passengers, and of all goods or
carriages of the same description, and conveyed or
propelled by a like carriage or engine passing over
the same portion of the line of railway under the same
circumstances, and no reduction or advance in any
such toll shall be made either directly or indirectly
in favour of any particular company or person
travelling upon or using the line.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Personal preferences were forbidden. But the companies
were to accommodate their rates to the circumstances of the
traffic, the Legislature&#8217;s mode of expressing the rule that the
traffic should pay what it could bear; and within the statutory
maxima, the companies were to be free to alter their tolls
as they thought fit.</p>

<p>How far this was altered by s. 2 of the &#8220;Railway and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Canal Traffic Act, 1854,&#8221; need not here be considered.
It is enough to say here that, so far as s. 90 was concerned,
differential rates were not only not prohibited, but distinctly
sanctioned. S.90 required equality only in regard to traffic
&#8220;passing between the same points of departure and arrival,
and passing over no other part of the line.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>For more than forty years railway companies have
been conforming to these principles. They have been
developing long as well as short distance traffic, and aiding
the opening of new industries. They have done so to
their own advantage, for though the return on the capital
expended on railways has been small, it has been obtained
on a large volume of traffic. They have been able to benefit
the commerce of the country to a degree which would
have been impracticable if, instead of rates being elastic
and freely accommodated to traffic, the traffic had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
forced to adapt itself to the rates. Producers pay what
they find it worth while to pay; they pay no more. In
framing the statutory classification, the Legislature assumed
that producers would probably find it worth while to pay
the authorised charges. The companies find out what such
producers can in fact pay, and what rates will best promote
traffic. What preferable rule could be substituted?

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>SECTION X.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">NEW CLASSIFICATION.</span></h2>

<p>One inconvenience incidental to the course taken by the
railway companies has been experienced. The actual classification
in use does not follow the meagre, and in many
respects arbitrary, statutory classifications; the latter may not
be a guide to the former. This was one of the grievances laid
before the Railway Rates Committee in 1881 and 1882. Traders,
it was said, could only with difficulty ascertain the companies&#8217;
powers to charge for goods not enumerated in their Acts.
The representatives of the railways agreed with some of the
witnesses who gave evidence on behalf of the traders as to the
original classifications in the Acts of the companies having
become obsolete. They explained that from time to time they
had been rectifying, in the manner already described, the
defects of the statutory classification, and that, acting on
information communicated by manufacturers and merchants,
and guided by their own experience, they had framed and
generally adopted the Railway Clearing House Classification,
which embraces some 2,700 articles, and which is, on the
whole, fairly adapted to the requirements of trade. They
added that the companies were prepared to agree to a revised
maximum classification in lieu of the original classification.</p>

<p class="space-below1">Accordingly, the Committee recommended&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;That there should be adopted over the whole Railway
system one uniform classification of goods.&#8221;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;That terminal charges should be recognised, but be subject
to publication, and, in case of challenge, to sanction by the Railway
Commissioners.&#8221;</p>

<p class="space-above1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
The Board of Trade thereupon intimated to the railway
companies their intention of introducing into Parliament a
Bill with the view of carrying out some of the recommendations
of the Committee, and requested them to prepare a
standard maximum classification for general adoption.</p>

<p>This was done. The companies were also prepared
to assent to a codification of their maximum rate clauses,
having due regard to their existing powers, so as to assimilate
them to the new classification. But they stipulated that
certain, rights which at that time were considered by some
to be doubtful&mdash;in particular, the right of the companies to
charge for terminal services&mdash;should, as; recommended
by the Committee, be recognised. The Bill introduced in
the Session of 1883 by the Board of Trade was not proceeded
with. Acting therefore on a suggestion which was
made to them, several of the companies introduced Bills
in the Session 1884-5, with a view to consolidate the
maximum rate clauses, and secure the adoption of a
general classification, and the recognition of terminals. But
the companies received from Government no such assistance
as they had reason to expect. The mere consideration of
their Bills was strongly opposed, the Board of Trade eventually
joining in the opposition; and the measures had to be
withdrawn. Last Session the Board of Trade introduced a
Bill, not only to compel the companies to do what they, by
their Bills introduced in the Session of 1885 sought to
do, but also to make it obligatory on them to accept such
altered rates and tolls as the Board of Trade, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
subsequent sanction of Parliament, might lay down, and to
submit to periodical revisions thereof&mdash;requirements so
contrary to the conditions on which the companies provided
the capital for the construction of the railways, that it is
difficult to believe that the effects of the provisions of the
Bill could have been clearly understood. The companies
unanimously objected to a measure which amounted to confiscation.
It is probable that a satisfactory arrangement
would have been come to; but owing to the dissolution of
Parliament the Bill was not proceeded with. In view of the
desire of the public for a new classification, the recommendation
of the Railway Rates Committee, end the general
assent of the companies, it may be assumed that in the
course of the next Session the subject will again be brought
forward; and it is therefore desirable to consider the principle
on which a classification should be framed.</p>

<p>In the earliest Canal and Railway Acts the basis of the
classification was the nature, bulk and value of the articles
carried. The lowest tolls were applicable to articles carried
in large quantities, such as lime, dung, coals, and rough
stone; the medium tolls to grain, timber, &amp;c., and the
higher to manufactured goods, and the more valuable articles
of merchandise, such as wool, tea, wines and spirits, &amp;c.
On canals, this classification was in force, notwithstanding
the fact that they were at first only toll takers, and did not
incur any cost in conveyance or any risk&mdash;services and
liabilities for which the carriers charged the public beyond
the tolls. The numbers of articles enumerated in the original
Acts were, as previously stated, from 50 to 60, divided generally
into from three to five classes. The present Railway
Clearing House classification, which has been revised from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
time to time, contains seven classes. The following is a comparative
statement of the number of different articles
enumerated in it during the last 34 years:&mdash;</p>

<p>Judging from remarks which have been made<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
as to the &#8220;inconsistency and want of classification,&#8221; it
appears to be the view of some persons that this classification has
been framed by the companies in an arbitrary manner and without
regard to the necessities of trade. Nothing could be
more erroneous than this assumption. Of necessity it is
from the traders themselves that the railway managers
have primarily obtained the information by which
they have been guided in framing the classification.
The questions to be determined in fixing rates are not
simple; the elements to be taken into account are
many. Whether the traffic is considerable, whether the
cubical contents are large or small in proportion to the weight
whether it is carried in large or small quantities, whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the merchandise consists of raw materials or manufactured
goods, articles of necessity or luxury, must be considered.
The requirements of traders with conflicting interests, the
different views taken by the companies, and the desire to encourage
special industries must be studied. In practice what
takes place is this. When a new article of commerce or of
manufacture is introduced, the merchant or manufacturer
calls on the railway company immediately interested to
have it classified and to fix the rates. Of course, there
is an endeavour to get it placed in the lowest possible class.
Such applications are carefully considered; and they are
from time to time discussed by the managers at their conferences.
Thus the classification is continually under
consideration and revision; there is a constant process of
re-adjustment to the changing circumstances of trade. So-called
anomalies there no doubt are, and departures from the
basis on which a classification should be framed. But the
Railway Clearing House Classification, which is the result of
this continual effort to adapt charges to new conditions,
answers reasonably, if not perfectly, the requirements of trade.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p class="space-below1">It must be borne in mind, in framing a new
standard classification, that it will be the maximum beyond which
the companies must not go. If adopted generally over
all railways, the scales of maximum rates must allow
scope for the local necessities and peculiarities of different
districts of the country. Inverness-shire and Cornwall,
as well as Staffordshire, Lancashire, and Yorkshire,
agricultural, manufacturing, and mining districts, must all be
considered. There must be sufficient elasticity in the scale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of maximum rates to allow of the charges being remunerative
on short distance traffic. Goods coming under the
same generic name often vary considerably in cubical contents
in proportion to weight, value, and risk of damage, as well
as in the extent to which they are carried; all considerations
not to be forgotten in constructing a uniform classification.
The following few examples, taken casually from consignments
actually carried, illustrate the remarkable variations
in the weights and bulk of some of the traffic:&mdash;</p>

The value of goods coming under the same description,
and the risk in conveying them, frequently vary as much as
the cubical contents. No matter what pains are taken to
frame a fair classification, it is to be feared that any classification
based on a careful consideration of the nature and
value of the articles carried, and all the varying circumstances
of trade&mdash;and an omission to consider any such
element would work injustice&mdash;must appear to some traders
to be more or less anomalous. Some will still consider
they have a grievance to lay before Chambers of Commerce.</p>

<p>It may be well to state how the problem has been dealt
with on the Continent. The particulars given may be
instructive to those who hastily recommend an adoption
of the systems in force abroad.</p>

<p>In France the classification of goods and rates is in a
transition state; and a large portion of the trading and
manufacturing classes are discontented with the charges at
present made by the railway companies. With a view of
simplifying the tariff, in 1879 the Minister of Public Works
took steps to frame for adoption on all the French Railways
a classification divided into six classes. Subsequently an
attempt was made to prepare a uniform scale of railway rates
diminishing according to distance. But after a long enquiry,
and full consideration, the proposal was abandoned. In 1883,
the Paris, Lyons, and Mediterranean Railway Company proposed
the adoption of a revised tariff, which professes to
afford, on the whole, a reduction in the rates as compared
with the former tariff. It was sanctioned by the Minister of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Public Works in August, 1885. It consisted of six classes for
general goods in any quantities, and six for goods of the
special classes, which are generally carried in lots of one
and five tons. The latter six classes were in substitution for
the many special tariffs formerly existing. The Eastern of
France Railway Company also revised their tariff, re-adjusting
the classification, and reducing the number of their
special tariffs to 28. An article formerly carried at a special
tariff between certain specified stations is now charged at the
fourth class rate. But when carried generally, and not between
particular stations, such an article remains, as before, in the
second class. The Northern of France Railway Company
have also revised their tariffs on a somewhat similar basis.</p>

<p>Long debates on the subject of the charges under the
new tariffs, and on the railways generally, took place in
the Chamber of Deputies, in February and March last.
There were complaints that the &#8220;reformed tariff,&#8221; and
particularly that of the Paris, Lyons, and Mediterranean Company,
had not brought about the anticipated reductions, and
that, while in some cases lower rates for certain goods carried
in large quantities had been conceded, higher rates had been
fixed for similar goods sent in small quantities. The rate
for 5 ton lots, for instance, is lower; but that for lots
under 5 tons is generally higher. The larger traders had
derived a benefit from the change; but the small traders and
consumers compared with what they were, are placed at a
disadvantage. So far the other companies have not made
any alteration in their tariffs.</p>

<p class="space-below1">Thus it will be seen that in France there
is no uniform classification. The tariffs of the companies, with
the exception of the Ouest, Nord and Est, are composed of a
different number of classes, and the number of articles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
enumerated in the classification also varies. Articles, too, are
not included in the same classes on all lines. For instance,
the Ouest enumerates 1686, the Nord 1519, and the Paris,
Lyons, and Méditerranée, 1425. The tariffs are divided&mdash;</p>

<p class="space-above1">The system actually existing in Germany is
a compromise. Previous to 1878 different systems existed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
North and South Germany. The classification in use in the
former was governed by the value of the goods; while that
in force in the latter was framed with particular reference
to their weight and measurement. In that year, however,
an attempt was made to reconcile the two systems; the
&#8220;Reform Tariff,&#8221; as it is called, was established on all the
German railways. There was a concession to the Southern
system; rates for goods in covered trucks in five or ten ton
lots were adopted. The North system, on the other hand,
was recognised by establishing the Special tariff classes, in
which the relative value of the goods has been taken into
consideration. The actual classification is therefore dual; it
is a compromise between two totally different systems.
Obviously it does not accord with the requirements which
have been put forward by, or on behalf of, traders in this country.</p>

<p>In Belgium, also, there is practically no classification
except for traffic in full truck loads. The tariff consists of&mdash;</p>

&emsp;For Tariffs 1, 2, and Class I. of tariff No. 3, there is
practically no classification. All goods up to the specified
weights are included, without reference to their value or nature.
Only in respect of the wagon-load classes of tariff No. 3 does
any classification exist. In this classification, which applies
to all the Belgian railways, about 639 articles are
enumerated. It is assumed to be framed with reference to
the value of the goods, the mode of transit, the amount of
the company&#8217;s responsibility, and the circumstance of the
goods being carried in open or covered trucks.</p>

<p>In Holland, the classification is very similar to that
which exists in Germany. Goods are divided into two classes,
i.e., &#8220;<i>Stückgut</i>&#8221; or &#8220;Piece&#8221; goods, to which belong all
consignments less than 5 tons carried by goods train; and
&#8220;<i>Truck Load</i>&#8221; goods, which includes goods in truck loads
of 5 or 10 tons, or which pay as for those weights. The
&#8220;<i>Stückgut</i>&#8221; class is subdivided into two classes, and the
&#8220;<i>Truck Load</i>&#8221; class into four classes. The total number
of articles enumerated in the classification is about 242.
Although the bases of the tariffs charged for conveyance
differ, the classification is practically the same on all the
railways in Holland. The following is an example of the
classification of goods on the Dutch Rhenish Railway. It
will be seen that such articles as coffee, cheese, butter, in
consignments of less than 5 tons, are included in the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
class as coal, coke, gravel and raw iron; a feature not likely
to be imitated by admirers of the &#8220;scientific classification&#8221;
supposed to exist abroad.</p>

some idea of the difficulty experienced in framing a classification

by observing the different manner in which goods placed in
the 2nd Class, under the Railway Clearing House Classification,

<p class="space-above1">Assuming that any maximum classification to

stated, and that it should accommodate trade in all districts of
the country, the classification suggested by the railway companies
in their Bills will bear the test of any fair inquiry. When the
change which we have indicated is carried out&mdash;when the
maximum rate clauses of the companies are consolidated and revised

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>SECTION XI.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">TERMINAL CHARGES.</span></h2>

<p>We come to another common complaint against railway
companies,&mdash;the one which, next to that relating to
differential and import rates, has lately been most heard of.
From time to time during the last 30 years, and especially
of late, the right of railway companies to make charges for
what are known as terminal services beyond the remuneration
for actual conveyance has been challenged. On the part of
the railway companies there has been no change of practice.
No new kind of charges has been imposed; those in dispute
have been made from the very beginning of railways in this
country. Introduced by the common carriers upon the
railways, they were continued by the railway companies.
On the strength of the right to receive these charges,
companies took upon themselves the carrying business,
constructed large goods stations, with vast siding and other
accommodation, and in providing land, premises and appliances,
expended an enormous amount of capital, not necessary
for earning the statutory mileage rates. The legality of
such charges has been, after full argument on appeal, upheld
by the Court of Queen&#8217;s Bench (<i>Hall v. London Brighton
and South Coast Railway Company</i>, L. R. 15 Q. B. D. 505):
their equitable character is not less clear, and the contention
to the contrary is, in the words of the joint judgment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of Mr. Justice Wills and Mr. Justice Mathew, &#8220;singularly
unreasonable.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;We have already mentioned the anticipation, in the
early days, that the railway companies would merely furnish
the railway and charge tolls for the use of it by carriers and
others, who would employ private locomotives, carriages and
wagons. The notion was borrowed from the experience as
to canals and highways; and it has been well said that &#8221;no
proper understanding of a good deal of our railway legislation,
and pre-eminently of clauses relating to tolls or
charges, can be arrived at, unless it (the theory) is firmly
grasped and steadily kept in view.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
On railways, as on canals, there were three states of circumstances
which it was considered must be provided for: First a railway
company, like a canal company, might simply provide a highway,
looking to the tolls alone for the use of that highway
for a revenue upon their capital; secondly, without themselves
being carriers, the railway company might provide trucks
and locomotive power, as the canal companies provided boats
and haulage power on the canal; or, thirdly, both the
canal company and the railway company might be carriers
upon the highway which they themselves had provided, and
find the wharves, stations, other necessary premises, accommodation
and appliances, and the capital for that purpose.</p>

<p>The owners of lands along the banks of canals were
entitled to construct, in connection with them, wharves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
basins and warehouses; and we find in the earlier railway
Acts, and in the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act
1845 (subject to which all railways since that date have been,
constructed), similar powers with respect to railways conferred
upon adjoining owners. They were authorised to construct
sidings and junctions for the purpose of making communications
between their own lands and the railway. It was
intended that a trader should load his wagons on his own
premises, carry them over the railway and take them off the
railway again at another siding or communication, paying
the railway company a mere toll for the use of the length
of line over which the traffic was in fact worked. Nor
was this a mere theory. For many years upon some of the
railways in this country the work of carrying merchandise
was, to a considerable extent, actually performed by large
firms of carriers, such as Pickfords, and others, who provided
their own siding accommodation with the railways, and built or
rented their own stations and warehouses. During this period
the railway companies, so far as this part of their traffic was
concerned, merely provided the highways, the wagons and
the engine power, and hauled the traffic from its place of origin
to its destination; and they undertook no responsibility as
common carriers in respect of the goods. The carriers provided
the station accommodation, loaded and unloaded the goods,
checked and weighed them, and handed over the loaded or
unloaded trucks to the railway company in a convenient
position for the engine to be attached to them. Of course, the
carriers, who undertook all liability as such, charged the public
not only the tolls which they paid to the railway company, but
also a considerable additional sum to cover the risk of their
Common Law liabilities, the cost of providing station and warehouse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
accommodation, clerkage and invoicing of goods, and
other services beyond the haulage of the trucks.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Upon some lines the state of things which we have described
existed for many years. But gradually the railway companies
began to undertake the duties and responsibilities of carriers.
They purchased or built, often at enormous expense, the
necessary terminal accommodation which, under the previous
system, had been provided by private carriers; and they
made to the public charges similar to those which the carriers
themselves had before made for corresponding accommodation
and services. The companies raised the large sums
required to furnish this accommodation and for their
working capital as carriers, upon the faith that they
were entitled to stand in all respects, in the place of the
carriers or forwarding agents, and to make reasonable charges
for accommodation and services not covered by, and obviously
having no relation to, the mileage rates for simple haulage
from point to point.</p>

<p>This view has been sanctioned by the Legislature in almost
all Railway Acts passed since 1845. The charges which a
company are authorised to make are of three kinds&mdash;first,
tolls for the use of the railway as a highway; secondly,
charges, in addition to the tolls, for the use of carriages,
wagons, and for locomotive power where such of them are
provided by the company&mdash;in other words, for conveyance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
along the railway. A third class of charges becomes due when
the company not merely convey the goods, as they would
for the carriers who had their own station accommodation
and staff, but are themselves the carriers; cases where,
in addition to providing the highway, vehicles, and locomotive
power, they perform &#8220;such services as are incidental to
the duty or business of a carrier.&#8221; These services include
the providing of stations, warehouses and sheds, where goods
are received, sorted, loaded, covered, checked, weighed, and
labelled, and trucks marshalled for convenient removal to
their various places of destination, and the maintenance of
a large staff of clerks, book-keepers, porters, workmen,
engines and horses necessary for these operations. In this
last case the company are entitled to make, in addition to the
charges proper to highway, rolling stock, and locomotive power,
a reasonable charge for the services, often costly and onerous,
rendered in their totally different capacity of carriers.</p>

<p>It is undisputed that if the railway companies
were not carriers and acted as toll takers only, they
would be entitled to claim their full tolls. But what would
be the result if they put in force such a right? The carriers
or forwarding agents who would replace them, naturally
would, as they formerly did, levy such payments as would
cover the cost of station accommodation, and all the services
performed in respect of the carriage of goods beyond the
mere conveyance along the railway. Can it have been
in the contemplation of the Legislature that railway
companies were not to be entitled to make the same charges?</p>

<p>Suppose a Bill were before Parliament for the construction
of a railway, and a clause requiring that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the mileage rates should cover the cost of terminal
accommodation were inserted, and the promoters accepted
the Bill with such a restriction. The construction of
a station at the terminus of the railway in a large town
is very costly, and it would be to the interest of the
company to make the station outside the town where
land and works would be cheap. They would thus save
capital upon which they would obtain no return, and, at
the same time, they would be entitled to charge the public
the full cost of cartage, whatever the amount might be.
The Great Western Company, for instance, might have
constructed their terminus at Wormwood Scrubs&mdash;from which
place the cost of cartage to the City would probably be 7s. 6d.
per ton, which the public would have to pay. With the
view of affording better accommodation and of reducing the
expense of cartage, they have erected a station under Smithfield
Market, at a cost, in interest on outlay, maintenance,
and other terminal expenses of an average of
3s. 8d. per ton. According to the opponents of terminal
charges the Great Western Company are only entitled
to be paid a mileage rate proportional to the distance from
Wormwood Scrubs to Smithfield, that is, as for seven miles,
to cover the use of the railway and the station. To take
other illustrations, could it be supposed that the London
and North Western Railway Company would have spent
several millions of capital in providing expensive station
accommodation in the immediate vicinity of the Docks in
Liverpool, instead of receiving and delivering the traffic at
Edge Hill, or that companies would have constructed vast
stations in London, Manchester, Leeds, and many other
important places, unless the cost was to be covered by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
payments in addition to the mileage rates? So inequitable and
opposed to the real interests of traders is this contention
that it is difficult to understand how it could ever be put forward.</p>

<p>One of the allegations before the Railway Rates
Committee in 1881-2, was, that the companies carried some
traffic at too low rates, and, to compensate themselves,
imposed higher rates than otherwise would be necessary on
other traffic. Now, if railway companies were not allowed
to charge for terminal accommodation and services, one effect
would be that in consequence of the cost of the construction
and the expenses of stations, short distance traffic would be
actually carried at a loss.</p>

<p>In recent years terminal charges have been recognised
in every Act for the construction of new railways, by the
introduction of a clause of which the following is a
copy:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;No station shall be considered a terminal
station in regard to any goods conveyed on the
Railway, unless such goods have been received
thereat direct from the consignor, or are directed
to be delivered thereat to the consignee.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>If the railway companies were not entitled to charge
terminals for the use of the stations, the insertion of
such a clause in Acts of Parliament would be meaningless;
the intention of the clause evidently was that the
companies may not charge terminals in respect of any
intermediate station or junction, and the fair inference is that
they may do so at the sending or receiving station.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The equitable mature of the claim of the railway
companies to make terminal charges has been admitted on
several occasions by some, if not by all, of the railway
commissioners. Their refusal to consider terminal charges as
legally justifiable has arisen only from the doubt which
existed in their minds as to the strict construction of the
words of the clauses; and that question has now been
decided by the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division in &#8220;<i>Hall</i>
v. <i>The London Brighton and South Coast Railway Company</i>.&#8221;
Some portions of the judgment of the Court in that case
deal only with the construction of the sections of the particular
Private Acts of the defendant company; but the
remarks of the Judges upon the general principles which
govern the railway companies, claim to make terminal
charges, explain so clearly their natural equity as well as
their legality, that they may not improperly be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&#8220;This notion of the railway being a highway for the common use
of the public, in the same sense that an ordinary highway is so,
was the starting point of English railway legislation. It is
deeply engrained in it. In the early days of railways it was acted
upon at least occasionally, and in respect of goods traffic, and
although it enters but slightly into modern railway practice, <i>no
proper understanding of a good deal of our railway legislation,
and pre-eminently of clauses relating to tolls or charges, can be
arrived at, unless it is firmly grasped and steadily kept in view</i>.
Those states of things were from this point of view to be expected
and to be provided for by legislation. The company might be merely
the owners of a highway and toll takers for the use of it by other
people with their own carriages and locomotives. That state of
things would be worked out by the railway company possessing the
mere line of railway from end to end, and by the persons making
use of it, buying or renting contiguous land whereon to keep their
rolling stock, and have their offices, availing themselves of the
powers of Section 76 of the Act of 1845, and getting on to the
railway by means of sidings connected with the railway.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;A second state of things, as we know from the evidence in this
case to which by the consent of the parties we are at liberty to refer,
prevailed extensively for many years after the railway system was in
full operation, and for some years at least after the passing of the
Act of 1845. The railway company provided the line and provided the
engines and trucks, but they were not carriers. The large warehouses
and sheds wherein goods were received, sorted, loaded, covered,
checked, weighed and labelled, and trucks or carriages marshalled
and prepared for convenient removal to their various places of
destination&mdash;a corresponding work was done in respect of goods
arriving from a distance&mdash;the staff of clerks, book-keepers, porters,
workmen, and horses necessary for these operations were all provided
and maintained at the expense of the carrier, and no portion of them
fell upon the company. The company, on the other hand, as owners
of the rolling stock, for the use of which, as well as of their
railways, they received payment, provided whatever accommodation
they needed in order to keep in convenient proximity to the places
where the carrier had his depôts the necessary supply of rolling stock.</p>

<p>&#8220;The third state of things which might exist simultaneously with
the second, or might be the one prevailing exclusively on a particular
line, existed when the company were themselves the carriers of the
goods, and when as carriers they provided the accommodation and
performed the services above described.</p>

<p>&#8220;The company might thus be: 1, toll-takers and neither conveyers
nor carriers; 2, conveyers but not carriers; 3, carriers. It would
naturally be expected that in the first case they would have powers
to take tolls, and tolls only, and that in the second, they would
have power to make charges, which should include tolls and charges
for the use of rolling stock, and it would seem reasonable enough
that (inasmuch as they would probably have much greater facilities
for keeping and using their rolling stock to advantage and with
economy than any other person could have) where they provided both
trucks and locomotives as well as took tolls, the maximum charge
should be lower than the aggregate of the three separate charges
which they might make for, 1, use of railways; 2, use of carriages;
3, locomotive power.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would seem natural also to expect that where the company
were carriers, inasmuch as they performed the identical services which
they perform under the second head, and others besides, they should
be allowed to charge the same sums as they might charge when falling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
under the second category, <i>plus</i> those which are appropriate to
the extra services and liabilities which fall upon them when they
undertake the duties and business of a carrier.</p>

<p>&#8220;The contention of the applicants appears to us singularly
unreasonable. It was proved before the Railway Commissioners,
and is not disputed, that the actual cost to the company of the
accommodation and services, which, for many years after the railway
system was very largely developed, and all the principal lines
in the kingdom were at work, were on some of the most important
railways in England provided by independent carriers, and did not
fall upon the railway company, amounted to 1s. 5d. per ton; and it
is admitted that, even with the help of the six-mile clause, the
company, if the contention of the applicants is correct, would,
in the case of traffic carried not more than six miles, have to
carry goods coming under class 5, at a dead loss, which may be
approximately stated as 8d. per ton for station services alone,
besides getting nothing for the use of railway and trucks and for
providing power.</p>

<p>&#8220;The charges of and incidental to &#8216;conveyance,&#8217; as we
have explained that phrase, are properly measured by the mile of distance
travelled over. The terminal services of station accommodation, loading,
watching, checking, and the like, have no common measure with the
distance run, and are the same, whether that distance be two or two
hundred miles....</p>

<p>&#8220;Our answer, therefore, is that the providing of station
accommodation, and work of the general nature indicated to us by the
Railway Commissioners, appear to us to be capable of falling under
the definition of &#8216;services incidental to the duty or business of a
carrier,&#8217; and <i>prima facie</i> to do so. Whether in any particular case
they do so, or to what extent they do so, must be a question of fact
for the Commissioners, the line we should draw being, that whatever
is necessary for &#8216;conveyance&#8217; in the sense in which we have defined
it&mdash;being all capable of being measured by reference to the distance
travelled&mdash;is covered by the mileage rate. Whatever is properly
incidental, not to conveyance, but to the performance of the duty
and business of a carrier ... that is to say, is actually performed
and is done at a terminal station, may be made the subject of a
separate reasonable charge.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could the Legislature ever provide for every single station on
this line, for every terminal station, what was a proper charge? It
could only be done by limiting it, as it has done, by &#8216;a reasonable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
sum,&#8217; and it is for the Railway Commissioners to say what is a
reasonable sum, under the circumstances at each terminal station.
&#8216;No station is to be considered as a terminal station in regard
to any goods conveyed on the railways of the company unless such
goods have been received thereat direct from the consignor of
such traffic, or are directed to be delivered thereat.&#8217; Therefore
terminal stations are recognised, and terminal charges are
recognised distinctly.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Sir Bernhard Samuelson observes that terminal charges
are a necessary corollary of the Foreign mileage rates,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
the scientific basis of which he so much approves; the equity of,
and right to make terminal charges is equally a corollary
to the system upon which the rates in this country have been
fixed. The maximum charges for the user of the road, the
user of the truck, and the provision of the engine are
capable of being fairly measured by reference to the distance
travelled. They are, therefore, properly the subject
of a mileage rate. But the providing of station accommodation,
and work which the Railway Companies perform
as carriers&mdash;as distinguished from mere conveyance&mdash;have no
relation to mileage. They must reasonably be&mdash;as it has
been held in the case of &#8220;<i>Hall</i> v. <i>The London Brighton
and South Coast Railway Company</i>,&#8221; they legally are&mdash;the
subject of an additional charge.</p>

<p>We may here correct a common error. The opponents of
terminal charges are in the habit of speaking and writing of
them as if the companies claimed that they might at their
own discretion demand such payments as they thought fit.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
The railway companies have never contended that they were
entitled to make arbitrary terminal charges. Indeed, such a
contention would be a legal absurdity. On the contrary, they
have always submitted that, while their right to make those
charges was undoubted, the amount must not only be
reasonable, but also be subject to review by the Railway
Commissioners under the 15th Section of the Regulation
of Railways Act, 1873. Sir Bernhard Samuelson is inaccurate
in stating that the railway companies proposed
by their Bills of last Session to make those charges subject
only to their own discretion. While strongly relying both
upon their legal right and the justice of their claim, the
railway companies were willing to submit proposals to the
consideration of Parliament for a re-settlement of their
powers in this respect. But they expressly provided that
the Railway Commissioners should have power to hear
and determine any question or dispute which might arise
with respect to the amount or reasonableness of any terminal
charge made by the company, and that any decision of the
Commissioners as to terminal charges should be binding
and conclusive on all Courts and in all proceedings whatsoever;&#8221;
words borrowed from s. 15 of the Regulation of
Railways Act, 1873.</p>

<p>A few details as to the law and practice on this subject
in Continental countries may be useful. And, first, as to
Germany. When the question of the introduction of a new
tariff for the German railways was under consideration, it
was agreed that in previously fixing the railway rates, sufficient
consideration had not been given to the expense
incurred at the sending and receiving stations, irrespective
of the distance the traffic was carried. The result of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the calculations which were made was that those expenses
should be estimated at 12 marks per truck load of ten
tons. This was accordingly adopted as the standard figure
for all goods carried in wagon loads, while for small consignments
the charge was fixed at 20 marks. The addition of those
normal allowances to the rates on traffic to be carried short
distances would have considerably increased the charges
previously made. It was accordingly agreed, as a compromise,
to graduate the terminal charges for short distances;
the graduation being simply the means of avoiding what
might have been considered a large increase in the railway
rates, in consequence of the adoption of the &#8220;reform tariff
system.&#8221; These terminals represent the working expenses at
the forwarding and receiving stations, the labour of receiving
the goods from sender, marshalling or shunting the trucks
to the sidings set apart for the delivery of the goods, and
also the expense incurred by railway companies for
stationery and clerkage; but they do not include the expense
of loading and unloading, except in the case of <i>Grande
Vitesse</i> and &#8220;<i>Piece Goods</i>,&#8221; They vary from 10d.
per ton in full truck loads of 10 tons, to 2s. per ton of general
goods, and in the special tariff classes, which include minerals,
from 7¼d. in full trucks of 10 tons to 1s. 2½d. per ton.</p>

<p>In Belgium there is a fixed charge of 1 fr. per ton
of 1,000 kilogrammes for the use of station and for
clerkage; but it does not include loading and unloading,
or booking, counting, or advice of arrival of goods, for all
of which services extra charges are authorised and, in fact,
made. This is practically a terminal charge.</p>

<p>In Holland the terminal charges vary from 1s. 2d.
to 1s. 6d. per ton in the truck load classes, and 2s. 6d.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
per ton in respect of ordinary or &#8220;<i>piece</i>&#8221; goods in
quantities of less than 5 tons. In the latter case the cost of
loading and unloading is included in the terminal charge,
but not in the truck load classes. In neither case are
weighing, counting, stamping freight note, labelling or
advice of arrival included. For all of these services extra
charges are made.</p>

<p>In France only small charges varying from 20 cents.
per ton for goods in full truck loads, to 35 cents. per ton
for goods in less quantities, are made for the use of
stations, though there are various charges for loading and
unloading, booking, advice of arrival, and other services.
Either, therefore, the traffic for short distances is carried
at a loss, or no adequate return to cover the use of station
and conveyance is obtained&mdash;a course, which, assuming
the outlay upon a railway is entitled to a fair return, is
opposed to sound commercial principles.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>

<h2>SECTION XII.<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">THE CONSTRUCTION OF RAILWAYS<br />IN ENGLAND AND ON THE CONTINENT.</span></h2>

<p>Sometimes it is asserted, although it is more often taken
for granted, that all railway rates on the Continent are more
favourable to traders than English rates. Upon this assumption
is based the contention that the reduction of the latter may
fairly be demanded. Whenever such statements have been
carefully examined&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> in the inquiry before the Joint Committee
of 1872&mdash;they have been proved to be erroneous. Nevertheless,
they are still constantly repeated. More than once it
has been publicly stated that in Germany, Holland, Belgium,
&amp;c., &#8220;rates are fixed on a scientific basis, and an intelligible
principle,&#8221; while in this country they are &#8220;haphazard and
estimates.&#8221; Seldom is there any attempt to make good
such assertions and criticisms. The report made by
Sir Bernhard Samuelson to the President of the Association
of the Chambers of Commerce of the United
Kingdom on the &#8220;Railway Goods Tariffs of Germany,
Belgium, and Holland, compared with those of this country&#8221;
is an exception, and on that account is specially important.
That report endeavours to prove by figures that rates in this
country are excessive. It has been cited&mdash;though, probably,
such was not the intention of the author&mdash;as if it were an
indictment of English railways; and the purport of it is to
show that English rates ought to be reduced, and that, unlike
the rates on the Continent they are fixed on no proper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
basis. Now, even if the difference between English and Continental
rates were as great as Sir B. Samuelson describes, no
inference unfavourable to English railways could be fairly
drawn. No comparison could be useful which did not take
into account the fact that railways in Great Britain have
been constructed with private capital subscribed and expended
on the faith of definite powers conferred on the
companies by Parliament. Sir Bernhard Samuelson, however,
passes lightly over the dissimilarities which mar
his comparison; the widely different circumstances under
which foreign lines were constructed; their much smaller
original cost per mile, and the fact that most of the lines to
which he refers were either constructed or assisted by the
State, have been purchased by it, or have received State
guarantees. The English railway companies obtained
simply authority from Parliament to purchase compulsorily
the land required, and to construct the necessary works.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
On the other hand, the railways in the countries to which
his report relates were, to a great extent, either originally
constructed by the State, or the companies have been
assisted by contributions towards the cost of construction,
or a minimum rate of interest upon the capital provided
and expended by them has been guaranteed to them, or the
lines have been afterwards acquired by the State.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that Sir Bernhard Samuelson&#8217;s report
gives no information as to the railways of France, though the
nearest of the Continental countries, and though many of her
products compete with ours. To correct this deficiency, it
may be desirable to mention a few facts. The French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Government constructed the first railways opened in that
country or made advances for that purpose without charging
interest; and they have since made or purchased other lines.
In aid of the original lines for which concessions for 99
years were granted, the State in France contributed a vast
amount, as appears by the following statement:&mdash;</p>

The total capital expended on French railways up to
the end of 1884 had increased to £532,960,000,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
of which sum the State had provided £148,680,000, or 27·9 per cent.;
in addition to which the subscriptions given by towns
amounted to ·8 per cent. Thus, up to December 31st, 1884,
the capital provided by the companies themselves was not
more than 71·3 per cent. of the whole. The French
Government have also guaranteed the dividend on four of
the great lines at rates varying from 7 to 12 per cent. Two
other great companies may pay 11 and 13·5 per cent. dividend
respectively before they can be called upon to construct
any new lines; while all the six companies may earn
dividends varying from 10 to 22 per cent. before they are
bound to divide any surplus with the Government.</p>

<p>A portion of the capital of each company is paid off
annually beyond the guarantee; and at the end of the
period of concession the railways will become the property
of the State. The advances made to the companies under
the guarantees by the Government, with interest at the
rate of 4 per cent., are to be repaid out of any surplus
beyond the maximum dividends which may be paid. If
at the end of 99 years, any of the companies still be in
debt, the Government are to be entitled to take without
payment as much of the rolling stock as may be required
to repay the debt, as far as the value of the stock may
do so. By the conventions of 1883, the Government
arranged with the companies to which they had given
guarantees, that when a request to that effect is made by the
State, new lines are to be constructed up to the amount of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
debts at the end of 1883. In some cases this duty is incumbent
only when the dividends paid by the companies reach or exceed
the maximum percentage already mentioned. In addition
to the large sum expended by the French Government
on, or towards the original construction of railways, the total
amount advanced to the companies to make up the guaranteed
dividends<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>

<p>In Holland also, the railways are owned to a large
extent by the State, to which belong 797 miles out of a total
of 1,617 miles. The State does not, as in Germany or
Belgium, work its own lines. It leases them upon certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
conditions to companies, viz., to a Company for working
the State railways and to the Holland Company. The
companies provide the rolling stock and staff, and maintain
the line; but they do not execute &#8220;works of art&#8221; or
repairs arising from circumstances over which they have
no control, such, for instance, as war, inundations, landslips,
&amp;c. Materials for the execution of works have to
be conveyed at a very low rate. All rates must be submitted
to the Minister of Public Works for his approval; and the
mails must be carried free. From the gross receipts are made
deductions at the rate of £67 per mile of single, and £134
per mile of double line per annum, which serve as a fund to
cover repairs. Eighty per cent. of the remainder is retained
by the company. The balance of the receipts belongs to
the State. If, however, the company&#8217;s percentage, plus the
deductions, do not amount to £644 per mile, the gross
receipts are so apportioned as to yield that amount. If the
net profit of the company exceeds 4&frac12; per cent. upon their
capital, the surplus up to 5 per cent. is divided equally
between the State and the company; and any further surplus,
is distributed in the proportion of four-fifths to the State and
one-fifth to the company. The total capital expenditure on

<p>There is a remarkable difference in the cost of construction
of English and Continental lines&mdash;a fact of which
Sir B. Samuelson takes no adequate account when he says
&#8220;the average cost of construction has been considerably less
in the case of German railways than in that of our own.&#8221;
Without citing many figures on the point, it may be stated
that at the end of 1884 the amount of capital expended in
the construction of railways in the United Kingdom was
£801,464,367, or £42,486 per mile of line opened; and in
England and Wales alone £665,055,879, or £49,854 per mile.

solely on cost per mile, those in force in the United Kingdom
and England and Wales respectively would exceed the rates of
other countries to the extent shown in the following table:&mdash;</p>

<h2>SECTION XIII.<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">WORKING OF ENGLISH AND CONTINENTAL RAILWAYS&mdash;<br />
COMPARATIVE FACILITIES AFFORDED BY THEM.</span></h2>

<p>So much for the strikingly different modes in which the
English and continental railways have been constructed;
the one system a history of unaided private enterprise, the
other a history of a policy pursued by great States with
the resources of Imperial Exchequers, and with English
experience as a guide. Had railways in this country received
the same assistance as foreign lines, the cost and working
expenses being the same, the demand that the former should
have rates as low as the latter would not be unreasonable.
But a comparison of the facilities afforded here and on
the Continent to trades and production will not be unfavourable
to the English companies. It will be seen that, in the
words of the late Professor Stanley Jevons, &#8220;Taking all
circumstances into account, England and Wales are better
supplied with railways than any other country in the
world,&#8221; whether we have regard to extent or efficiency.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is well known that the time
occupied in the conveyance of goods is less in this country
than on foreign railways. In France, for instance, the
time allowed by the orders of the Minister of Public
Works, before forwarding for the purpose of loading, is
one day; for the transit of goods over a distance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
93 miles, there is another clear day&mdash;making two days;
and for a distance of 170 miles, three days, exclusive of
the time necessary for collection and delivery. In other
words, traffic delivered at a station on a Monday, must
be at the disposal of the consignee on the Thursday morning
following at any station within 150 kilometres (93 miles)
distant from the sending station. If the goods have to be
&#8220;delivered to domicile&#8221;&mdash;that is, at the consignee&#8217;s residence
or place of business&mdash;the time allowed by the tariff for
delivery is one day&mdash;that is, in the case supposed, they must
be &#8220;delivered to domicile&#8221; during the Thursday. No
doubt, goods requiring speedy transit can be forwarded by
<i>grande vitesse</i> (ordinary passenger train), a service which
is equivalent in respect of speed to a large portion of the
goods trains in England. But the rates charged for
conveyance by <i>grande vitesse</i> in France are about three
times as much as the highest class rate by goods train.</p>

<p>In Germany, the general regulations prescribe the maximum
time for delivery of goods as follows: for &#8220;<i>Eilgut</i>&#8221; (goods
carried by passenger train), one day for loading and forwarding,
and one day for every 300 kilometres (186 miles)
or part thereof. For &#8220;<i>Frachtgut</i>&#8221; (goods train traffic), two
days may be taken for loading and forwarding, and for the first
100 kilometres (62 miles) one day; for every part of each
subsequent 200 kilometres (124 miles) one day. The time
of transit is assumed to commence at midnight following the
date of the stamp on the consignment note.</p>

<p>In Holland, the time allowed for &#8220;express goods&#8221;
before forwarding is 24 hours, and for conveyance for each 186
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
miles or part thereof, another 24 hours.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
For general goods the time allowed before forwarding is 48 hours and
for the conveyance, 48 hours for each 186 miles or part thereof. As
in Belgium, the time allowed for transport commences at midnight
following the stamping of the consignment note.</p>

<p>In Belgium all goods carried under the conditions of
tariff No. 3<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
(which applies to consignments exceeding 4 cwt. in weight)
are due at the receiving station three full days
after delivery of the goods to the company. This does not
apply if there is a glut of traffic; and another full day is
allowed if the railway company deliver by cart.</p>

<p>Goods may by law be kept in some of the countries
which have been mentioned for two days before being
despatched; two clear days are allowed for 186 miles or part
thereof; and when rapid transit is required, as in case of express
goods, the rates are much higher than those charged by
goods train. In this country, on the other hand, goods are,
as a rule, forwarded on the day or during the night of the
day on which they are brought to the station; and between
important places within 200 miles, goods are usually delivered
the following day. As a matter of general practice, the
maximum time allowed abroad is not fully occupied; but it
is recognised by law. This advantage which the foreign railways
possess implies others, which can only be fully appreciated
by persons practically acquainted with the mystery
of railways. The ample time allowed before forwarding and
in transit permits of considerable economy in the use of
wagons. Opportunities are afforded for making full wagon
and full train loads. This circumstance, too, reduces train
mileage. A further consequence is the diminution of claims
for compensation and in other items of expense. The speed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
of the trains being slow, and the time allowed in transit
being great, larger loads are practicable.</p>

<p>Liability for compensation for delay or damage in
transit is another element to be taken into consideration
in any comparison of rates. In Belgium and Holland,
where rates are especially low, the liability to pay compensation
is very limited. Belgian railway companies are not
responsible in the case of goods carried under the conditions
of tariff No. 2, unless specially insured, for a delay of one
day after the time allowed for delivery, or in the case of
goods carried under tariff No. 3 (all consignments above
4 cwts.), for a delay of two days after the time allowed for
delivery. Their responsibility for delay in excess of these
times is, moreover, limited to one-tenth of the carriage for
every day&#8217;s delay. Goods are considered to be lost if not
delivered after the expiration of fifteen days. For loss or
damage to merchandise, carried by goods train, the companies
are responsible only to the extent of 75 cents. per
kilogramme (3½d. per lb.). The responsibility of the companies
in Holland, for delay to ordinary goods beyond
24 hours, after the time allowed for delivery, is, up to
72 hours, limited to one-fourth, up to 8 days one-third, and
beyond that period one-half of the freight. For whole or
partial loss the maximum liability is £2 10s. per cwt. To
enable the public to recover, either in the case of delay or
loss, the full value of goods, they must be insured at specified
rates. These particulars show the advantages of foreign
railways in this respect; the difference may be made still
clearer by citing a few figures as to the working of this
system of legal limitation of liability in Belgium and
Holland and of the virtually unlimited liability in force in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
this country. In Belgium the amount paid for compensation
for delay or damage to merchandise traffic carried on the
State railways in the year 1884 was £7,772, or ·25 per
cent. on a revenue of £3,088,109, and on the Dutch Rhenish
Railway it was £274, or ·16 per cent., on a revenue of
£173,079. In the United Kingdom the amount was
£202,400, or, ·54 per cent., and in England and Wales
£17,140, or, ·55 per cent., on a revenue from merchandise
and mineral traffic of £37,670,592 and £31,973,011
respectively. Of these last amounts £15,528,656 and
£13,398,433 were in respect of minerals on which no compensation
is, in practice, payable.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The rates for merchandise in Holland and Belgium are
the lowest of any of the countries. Independently of the
construction of the lines being cheaper, the wages paid to
servants less, and the State being the principal proprietors,
natural causes favour this. From the flatness of those
countries and their consequently having exceptionally level
railroads, the average loads far exceed what can be carried
in the United Kingdom. In Holland 450 to upwards
of 500 tons are the usual train loads. Even on the
Northern Railway of France an average load of 400 to
450 tons is common. Owing to the gradients of the
lines and the speed of the trains, such weights are rarely
carried in this country. The consequence of the paying
load being less is, of course, that the working expenses
are proportionately greater.</p>

<p>Branch lines in this country have, as has been already
stated, been carried into sparsely populated districts to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
an extent unknown in France, Germany, Belgium or
Holland, and the English railways afford greater facilities
by reason of a larger proportion of the lines being double.</p>

<p class="space-above1">In comparing the results of the working
of the German and English railways, Sir B. Samuelson states in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the report already quoted, that &#8220;The proportion of net to
gross receipts is not unfavourable to the German lines.&#8221;
He adds that &#8220;it is all the more remarkable when it is considered
that the tariffs for both passengers and goods are
much lower; the cost of materials, generally speaking,
higher; and that large sums are in Germany defrayed
out of revenue, which would here be charged to capital.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
The meaning, apparently, of these observations is that
railways in this country ought to be worked more cheaply
than in Germany; that passenger fares and merchandise
rates are lower in that country, that nevertheless the receipts
are satisfactory; that the rates for goods should be here
reduced; and that, thereby, better results would ensue.
Let us put these statements to the test of figures,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
and, first, as to cost of working, no doubt a material element
in the comparison of rates. For the year 1884 the gross receipts
of all the railways in the United Kingdom and in England
and Wales respectively amounted to&mdash;</p>

<p class="space-above1">From the above table it appears that the
percentage of the working expenses upon the gross receipts on all
the railways in Germany is 54·31 per cent., and on the State
lines in Belgium 59·72 per cent. as compared with 52·77
per cent. in the United Kingdom. But analysing these figures,
we find that the relative proportion of the whole receipts
from the passenger traffic of the German railways is 26·79
per cent., and of the Belgian State railways 33·71 per cent.,
as compared with 42·58 per cent. in the United Kingdom.
This difference, due to the greater development of passenger
traffic in this country, considerably affects the comparison of
the results of working. The ratio of working expenses in
the United Kingdom, where the proportion of net revenue
from passenger traffic is greater, and that from goods is
less than in Germany or Belgium, is reduced to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
advantage of the goods traffic. If the revenue from
passenger traffic in the year 1885, on the railways in
the United Kingdom, had only been the same per train
mile as in Belgium, the working expenses in the case of
the former would have been raised to 59 per cent. The
profits derived from passenger traffic are not only advantageous
to the shareholders, but beneficial to the trade of
the country. They have enabled the companies to pay
moderate dividends, and also to carry merchandise traffic at a
less profit. Any reduction in the revenue from passengers
would cripple the railway companies, and prevent them
being in as good a position to provide the accommodation,
afford the facilities, and charge such rates as are required to
develop the trade of the country.</p>

<p>Sir Bernhard Samuelson&#8217;s reference to passenger fares
calls only for a few remarks. Taking the average fares charged
in this country per mile to be 2d. first, 1½d. second, and 1d.
third class, with a reduction in return tickets, there is no
very substantial difference between those fares and the fares
charged in Holland and Germany (except that in the latter
country there is a fourth class on some trains). Nor do fares
here (including the Government duty), materially differ from
those charged on the railways in France. The fares in Belgium
are, for the reasons already stated, lower than those
in this country. But if to the nominal fares is added the
charge which would be made for the same weight of
luggage as that which is carried free in this country, the
difference is reduced.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The receipts per train mile from coaching traffic are
3s. 1&frac34;d. and 3s. 4&frac14;d. in Belgium and Germany respectively,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
as against 4s. 2d. in the United Kingdom; a difference
which, assuming that only the same receipts per train mile
on the present train mileage were earned by the railways in
this country, would involve a loss of revenue from £6,000,000
to £7,000,000 per annum. On the other hand, the receipts
per train mile, from merchandise and mineral traffic, in the
other countries, compare very favourably with those in the
United Kingdom; they are 9s. 8&frac12;d. in France, and 9s. 10&frac34;d.
in Germany, as compared with 5s. 11d. in the United
Kingdom. Even in Belgium and Holland, where rates are
low, the receipts are 5s. 11&frac12;d. and 6s. 4&frac34;d. respectively; results
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
which, considering the low transit and other rates in the former,
and the transit and special bargain rates in the latter, are satisfactory.
Such figures show that, in addition to the advantages
of better gradients and slower speed of trains, wagons and
trains are more fully loaded than in this country; they show,
too, that notwithstanding the low tariff rates in many cases, the
additional charges referred to in Appendix I., page vii&mdash;over
and above the tariff rates&mdash;must yield a substantial
revenue. Nor should we lose sight of the fact that traffic
receipts in this country include, to a much greater extent than
in those countries, charges for loading and unloading.</p>

<p>In the passage which we have quoted it is said that &#8220;the
cost of materials&#8221; on the Continent is, &#8220;generally speaking,
higher.&#8221; One cannot help observing the inconsistency of
maintaining that the competition of the other countries by
enjoying low railway rates injures the export trade of this
country, and that the railways here have the advantage of
obtaining fuel and rails cheaper. Is the latter statement
clearly well-founded in view of the fact that German rails
have been laid on some of the English lines, and that engines
have also been supplied by Continental firms competing with
home makers? The truth, probably, is that for the purposes
of the present comparison the prices of coal and materials at
the pits and works in each country may be taken to be about
the same; that here, as abroad, there is great diversity of
circumstances; that in each country some companies, whose
railways are near collieries and ironworks, have the benefit
of the lowest prices, while others obtain their supplies by
sea or rail at an enhanced cost.</p>

<p>The chief item of expense in the working of railways, and
that which is of the greatest importance in making any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
comparisons intending to show that railway rates in this country
should be reduced, is that of wages; an item of expenditure
ignored in the above statement. Here they are generally
higher, and the hours of labour are fewer, than in any of the other
countries referred to. It is difficult to make an absolutely
trustworthy comparison of the actual sums paid in salaries and
wages. Different systems of payment exist; the allowances
made to the staff on the Continental lines in the way of house
rent, &amp;c., and the amounts contributed by the companies to the
superannuation and other benevolent funds ought not to be
forgotten; such contributions, especially in France, amount
in a year to a considerable sum. On the whole, however, we may
arrive at an approximately correct estimate by taking the total
amounts paid in salaries and wages and the average amount
paid per man per year. The following is the percentage
of wages as compared with the total working expenses.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>The hours of labour are an element in the matter. We
do not go into detail, or endeavour to make a precise comparison.
But it will not be disputed that, as a rule, they
are fewer here than on the Continental lines. Here, too,
there is, comparatively speaking, very little Sunday duty,
which is far from being the case abroad. On most of the
railways in this country it is the practice to provide at the
company&#8217;s own cost clothing for such of their staff as wear
uniform. The Dutch companies also supply some members
of their staff with clothing. But in France, Belgium,
and, generally, in Germany, the cost of clothing supplied to
the uniform staff, which has been omitted in the comparisons,
is deducted from their wages by instalments.</p>

<p>For the reasons already stated, there is no small difficulty
in comparing the rate of wages per day or per week.
Although in this country annual allowances such as bonuses
for good conduct are known, wages are, as a general rule,
fixed sums per day or per week, increasing according to
the importance of duties and service. On some of the
Continental railways the allowances are in some instances a
considerable percentage of the fixed wages.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The following table has been prepared from the best
information that could be obtained on the subject, and it may
fairly be taken as an approximate estimate of the average
wages paid:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>

<p class="space-above1">No such payments as these are made to the Governments
or parishes by the railway companies in Belgium or Holland,
or in respect of the State lines, in Germany. In Belgium,
for instance, the railway companies pay no rates and taxes of
any kind except small sums to towns for local rates (which
amounted in the aggregate to only £1,468 for the year 1884),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
and a license duty or income tax to the State of 2 per cent.
on the annual profits amounting for the same year to £4,406,
a total of £5,874 for the year.</p>

<p>In Germany the whole amount paid by the railways for
rates and taxes in the same year was £261,221, together
with a State tax of £26,209, paid under the head of &#8220;tax
on profits,&#8221; by the independent and semi-independent
companies only, and not by the State railways. This made a
total for the year of £287,430.</p>

<p>The railway companies in Holland do not pay any
rates and taxes, except a license duty to the State of
2 per cent. on the dividends paid to the shareholders. Indeed,
Article No. 8 of the Convention of the 24th and 25th
May, 1876, for the working of the State railways by the
Dutch Company, stipulates that the railways shall be exempt
during the period of the Concession, from all Government
taxation or payments to towns or parishes.</p>

<p>In France the condition of things is different.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
Although there is no taxation on merchandise traffic, the
payment in respect of passenger and <i>grande vitesse</i> traffic,
which is added to and levied with, the railway charges, is
heavy, and amounted in the year to £4,683,937.</p>

<p>The other taxes paid by the railway companies
themselves, or by the holders of shares, &amp;c., amounted to
£1,490,415, making together a total for the year of
£6,174,352.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Such are a few of the differences in the position and
rights of English and Continental railways, and those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
depreciate the former should explain whether they wish to
adopt all the practices of foreign lines&mdash;the features unfavourable
to traders as well as the advantages, slow transit,
very limited liability for loss of goods or damages to them,
and exemption from fiscal burthens which English railways
bear&mdash;and how the cost of working, especially in the item of
wages, can be reduced.

<h2>SECTION XIV.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">HIGH RATES AND THEIR EFFECT ON TRADE.</span></h2>

<p>It is not uncommon to attribute much of the existing depression
of trade to rates charged by railways. Before the Royal
Commission which lately investigated the subject, many
statements to that effect were made. Against their accuracy
there is a strong presumption in the fact that trade has been
in recent years depressed elsewhere, and in countries supposed
to enjoy lower rates than exist here. When particulars of
the exact nature of these complaints are furnished&mdash;which is
seldom done&mdash;it is found for the most part that there is no
real connection of cause and effect between railway charges
and depression in trade; that the latter revives or declines
independently of the former; that for the most part, the
evils complained of are beyond the power of railway companies
to remove; and that the complaints are contradictory.
Two of the forms which these complaints have taken may be
noted. One is the statement that<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
differential rates operate in favour of the foreign producer, and that works are being
removed from inland to seaboard towns to save carriage.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
Obviously this grievance could be wholly abated only by
free carriage; producers on the sea coast, near points of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
shipment, inevitably possess certain advantages. These again
could only be materially reduced by differential rates somewhat
lessening the inland producer&#8217;s geographical disadvantages;
and to this remedy the persons loudest in their complaints
most strongly object. Another form which such
complaints take may be noted. The following extract is
from a paper sent in by the Mining Association of Great
Britain to the Royal Commission on Trade:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;The heavy trades of coal and iron are also unduly burdened by
the high rates and tolls charged by the Railway Companies. They
are slowly but surely killing the trade of the country by their high
charges and by the preference given to foreign countries.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Charges against Railway Companies are, generally,
of a vague character. But this statement is sufficiently
definite to make it possible to test its accuracy by
comparing the rates charged for conveying the articles
referred to, viz., iron and coal, to some of the chief
ports in this country, with the corresponding rates of
other neighbouring countries. The following is a comparison
of a few of the rates charged for coal and iron in
England with those to Belgian and German Ports:&mdash;

<p>Such figures are a conclusive answer to charges of the
sweeping character we have quoted. They are a warning
of the peril of generalizing from a few hastily collected
local instances. The owners of some inland collieries
and manufactories, not so favourably situated as their
rivals, might have reason to complain&mdash;there would be
plausibility in the statements we have quoted&mdash;if English
coal and iron were inferior to foreign, and could not bear
the same charges as foreign products, or if collieries and
iron works, near the sea, were unable to supply more coal
and iron than they now do. Neither supposition is true.
The house and steam coal raised at some of the English
collieries named in the foregoing tables is probably the best
in the world. The iron and steel are equal, if not superior,
to any produced; and the districts in which the collieries and
works are situated can (if only there were the demand,
which, unfortunately, there is not) produce much more than
they do. In these circumstances, with rates so favourable
as those which are quoted, there appears to be absolutely
no ground for the crude allegation that railway rates are
the cause of the diminished exportation of either coal, iron,
or steel.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>As regards the conveyance of minerals and goods, there
is no sign of decline of trade, far less that it is &#8220;slowly, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
surely killed by high rates and tolls.&#8221; Taking three tests:
receipts from minerals and goods, tonnage conveyed and
amount produced&mdash;it will be seen that the figures stated in
Appendix II. indicate no decline. The volume of trade
is larger, lower prices may rule; but this will scarcely be
attributed to the action of rates.</p>

<p>Even when foreign rates seem lower, the difference is
often more apparent than real. With few exceptions the
English rates for merchandise traffic include the charges for
loading and unloading, collection and delivery, and all the
other services connected with conveyance. On the other
hand, the foreign rates are exclusive of collection and
delivery, and of the various other services of booking, weighing,
advising, stamping freight note, &amp;c., and also of the cost
of loading and unloading, except in the case of part loads in
Belgium, where the rates include compulsory charges for
loading and unloading.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>In judging of the effect of rates in encouraging foreign
competition, one circumstance must not be lost sight of. If
railways in this country do not carry all species of merchandise
traffic at as low rates per ton per mile as some of
those charged on railways in countries where, not only has
the cost of construction been less than here, but where the
lines are owned or subsidised by the State, such a fact is not
conclusive. To determine how far rates charged in this
country really affect the ability of manufacturers to compete
with foreign rivals, the charges per ton per mile must not
alone be considered. The <i>gross rate per ton</i> from the place
of production to the port of export is important. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
manufacturer cannot fairly say that he is prevented from
competing with his foreign rivals by rates less in the
aggregate than those paid by the latter. Otherwise one
whose works were situated within 20 miles of a sea-port,
and who paid 1¼d. per ton per mile for the conveyance of
his goods, might with equal justice say that he could not
compete with another manufacturer whose works were
50 miles from the port of shipment, and who paid only a
1d. per ton per mile. 2s. 1d. is less than 4s. 2d., however the
sums may be made up. Now, such superiority of situation
English manufacturers, as a rule, must from the nature of
things enjoy. A glance at a map will show that in England
no such distances have to be traversed to get to the seaboard
as in Germany, France, and, in some instances, Belgium.
In England there is no place 100 miles distant from the
coast, and so numerous are the ports, and so near to them,
relatively speaking, are the great coal districts and centres
of other industries and manufactures, that producers of coal
are more favourably situated, and other producers are, in
general, more favourably situated than those on the
Continent, especially as compared with those of France and
Germany. To illustrate this fact, a few examples of
various manufacturing centres may be given.

<p class="space-above1">Such natural disadvantages foreign countries have, by
special rates, sought to diminish, but they cannot be wholly effaced.</p>

<p>It is a curious circumstance that in the discussion of the
problem of railway rates on the Continent, wholly different
language is employed with reference to English railways.
Here, it is common to hold up foreign railways as models of
cheapness and efficiency; there, in the discussions which
have taken place in France and Italy on the same subject,
the opposite course has been pursued. English railways
have been extolled as worthy of imitation; they have often
been praised for the very qualities in which it has been
alleged in recent discussions that they are wanting. Can
both views be right? Is not this deprecation of home
railways, this vague praise of foreign lines, sometimes an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
example of a common artifice of controversy? Is it not often
an illustration of the tendency to treat <i>omne ignotum pro
magnifico</i>? Very different from this loose, unverified deprecation
is the opinion of those foreign observers who have
carefully examined the question. This might be illustrated
by many official documents; but the following quotation
from a report of M. Richard Waddington to the Chamber
of Deputies may suffice:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;Comparison between the French and foreign rates has often
been made in Parliament, and the defenders of our tariff have presented
it as favourable to our French companies; but this comparison
can only justly be made, provided the conditions of delay and
distance are taken into consideration. Now, in England, the delays are
extremely short, merchandise which leaves Manchester in the evening
being delivered in London next day, slow goods trains hardly
existing, and the consignee placed rapidly in possession of his goods,
avoiding the loss of interest which, under the French system, tends
to increase the amount of charges. On the other hand, in view of a
well-known principle, the longer the distance the lower the charge
per kilometre, but the average distance of 135 kilometres (84 miles)
in the French system is greater than the average distance travelled
on the railways of Great Britain, of Belgium, and of Alsace-Lorraine.
From the figures which have been already quoted, and
the documentary evidence which we attach, we are led to conclude
that the conditions and rate of carriage of merchandise in France are
less favourable than those by which our nearest neighbours are
benefited; therefore, far from being able to share the optimist view
to which we have already alluded, we fear that we can only report
that the comparison is really unfavourable.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Such facts are familiar to foreign merchants and
traders; and it might be well in future discussions of the
comparative merits and efficiency of English and Continental
railways, to gather information as to the latter from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
persons who are conversant with their working, and not
from those who can know them only imperfectly and indirectly,
and who may have an interest in praising them to
the disadvantage of the former.</p>

<p>If high rates impede the progress of trade it must be by
raising the prices of commodities, and so diminishing the
demand for them, or by seriously reducing the profits of
producers. Have those who complain of the effect of rates
on prices established the existence of either of these results?
They have had before them, as a rule, only a few special
instances of unfavourable rates. They have ignored the mass
of cases in which the charge for conveyance is a trifling
element in price. They have not, as would be but fair, taken a
large group of articles, and noted how insignificant is the cost
of transport as compared with other charges, how small is the
rate of profit of the railways as compared with the charges
of the manufacturers and distributors. Here it is not right
to stand merely on the defensive; we are well warranted
in saying that if, fortunately, trade is not more depressed
than it is, we owe this in no small degree to the efficiency
of the railway system which has aided the manufacturer
and producer in their difficulties. Economists are agreed
that wages and salaries must bear some relation to cost of
living, and must eventually rise if that becomes permanently
dearer. Everywhere, but in great towns especially, railways
have prevented the rise in the cost of provisions. They have
made it possible for people to obtain food from great distances
at low prices, and thus for employers to obtain labour at prices
which might not have been possible but for the cheapness of
provisions. The few figures given in the following table
may be instructive:&mdash;

<p class="space-above1">We now touch a question which comprehends most of
those already discussed. When it is stated, as it often is,
that the rates charged by the railway companies in this
country are generally too high, what exactly is meant? Is
it contended that shareholders should be content with
smaller dividends than they receive? Let us note the facts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
The average dividend in the year 1884 was only 4&frac14; per
cent.; in 1844 it was considered by the Legislature that, at
least, 10 per cent. should be earned by the shareholders. In
the United Kingdom the average rate of dividend paid
during the last 14 years on the capital expended on the
construction of railways&mdash;which, as already shown, was, at
the end of 1884, £801,464,367, and in England and Wales
£665,055,379&mdash;was only 4·38 per cent. For the year
1884, out of a total of £298,980,000 of ordinary capital,
£48,000,000 paid no dividend at all. As an illustration of
the moderate return on the shareholders&#8217; capital, it may be
mentioned that the Great Western Railway Company, which
owns, or jointly owns, 2,496 miles of railway, has during
the last 30 years only paid an average dividend of
£3 15s. per cent. per annum.</p>

<p>The meaning of the statement cannot be that, as compared
with the dividends of other industrial companies, those of
railways are too high. The facts are all the other way.</p>

<p>If a comparison is made of the percentage on capital
earned by Banks, Insurance, Gas and Water Companies,
some of which possess monopolies in a strict legal sense, and
not merely in the loose popular acceptation of the word, as
applied to railways, it will be seen that these returns are far
in excess of those derived from railway capital; that not
only is the average dividend, but the maximum dividend
higher, and that there are fewer instances of shareholders
obtaining no returns. Upwards of sixty Banks pay
dividends ranging from 10 to 15 per cent., and twenty from
15 to 20 per cent.; thirty-four Insurance Companies pay
from 10 to 15 per cent., and twenty-three over 15 per cent.;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
and ninety-three Gas and Water Companies pay dividends
ranging from 5 to 15 per cent. The average dividends of
Banks are 11·83 per cent., of Insurance Companies 12·45 per
cent., of Gas Companies 10 per cent., and of Water
Companies 5·73 per cent. In face of the above figures, and
of the prospects which were held out to those who invested
the capital with which the railways have been constructed, it
will probably not be directly contended that the present
dividend of less than 4&frac14; per cent, is a sufficient return on
railway property. Nor is such an income fixed. There is
no inconsiderable uncertainty affecting the income and the
net return from the working of railways.</p>

<p>It is alleged that the railway system is not properly
managed, and that in some way&mdash;how it is rarely explained&mdash;the
railways might be more profitably worked; that even
if considerably reduced rates were charged, as good, or a
better, dividend might be earned; or that as a consequence of
reducing rates such additional traffic would be carried that
the loss would be more than covered by the increased trade.
Now, no doubt undue competition between companies exists.
The largest possible amount of net revenue is not always
obtained. But such an admission affords little encouragement.
Here something more than vague general statements
are needed; it is incumbent on those who call for a great
change to produce facts justifying an expectation that, consistently
with a reasonable dividend, a considerable reduction
can be made in the rates for merchandise. No attempt has
ever been made to show that this can be done, and experience
is against it. The most plausible argument is, that by
reducing rates the present trade would be considerably increased,
that new sources of traffic would be created, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
that the companies would be more than recouped the loss
which they would sustain by any falling off in the receipts
on their traffic. This prospect was held out by the late
President of the Board of Trade in introducing the Railway
and Canal Traffic Bill. He justified his expectations by
stating that the companies who had adopted a cheap
passenger system, had reaped great advantages therefrom.
Few of them will consider this illustration to be fortunate.
Even, however, if the result of the changes in passenger
fares had been generally as beneficial as Mr. Mundella
seems to have supposed, no comparison can be drawn
between carrying a greater number of passengers in trains
only partly filled, and conveying additional mineral and
goods traffic by trains which must necessarily entail additional
mileage and all the attendant expenses. Take,
for instance, coal carried at ·50d. per ton per mile and that
the rate is reduced to ·45d.; that is a reduction of 10 per
cent. in the rate. Assume a train of 240 tons and 1s. 6d.
per train mile each way&mdash;that is for the loaded and return
empty wagons&mdash;as the average cost of haulage and maintenance
of way, it would require an increase of 16·6 per
cent. in the traffic, to leave a railway in the same position
as it was before.</p>

<p>The result of such a course as is recommended would
be, to say the least, problematical, as the suggested reasons
for it are not unknown to the managers of railway companies,
and have been carefully considered by them.

<h2>SECTION XV.<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">PROPOSALS FOR FIXING RATES BY RAILWAY COMMISSION&mdash;<br />CONCILIATION COURTS.</span></h2>

<p>One of the many proposals for fixing, or controlling rates
was contained in a clause in the Railway and Canal
Traffic Bill of last session. It was intended to confer
on the Board of Trade the power at any time, &#8220;on the
application either of a railway company, or of any Local
or Harbour Board, any Council of a City or Borough,
any representative County body which might hereafter be
created, and Justices in Quarter Sessions assembled, any
Public Local Authority which is now or might hereafter be
established, any Association of Traders or Freighters, or any
Chamber of Commerce or Agriculture, who should obtain a
certificate from the Board of Trade that they were entitled
to make such application, to revoke, amend or vary the
maximum rates.&#8221; This would have been a totally new
departure in legislation. Such statutes as the Railway
and Canal Traffic Act of 1854, and the Regulation of Railways
Act, 1873, exhibit an inclination on the part of
Parliament to jealously limit the powers granted to the
companies. The tendency of the Courts of Law has been to
construe the Acts strictly against companies and give the
public the benefit of all doubtful points.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
But it had never before been supposed that the powers to charge the rates and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
tolls contained in the original Acts, under which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
companies undertook the construction of the railways, could be
indefinitely altered, as proposed in the above clause. No
such recommendation was made by the Railway Rates Committee
of 1882. After what took place in the discussion of
the Bill, both in Parliament and out of it, and the
announcement of the then Attorney General, &#8220;that no one
contemplated a perpetually recurring revision,&#8221;&mdash;which the
clause provided for&mdash;it is not probable that any such suggestion
will again authoritatively be made.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Another proposal of a somewhat similar character is,
that the Railway Commissioners, or some other special
tribunal, should fix the rates. Were a Court for the control
of rates established with the consent of all concerned, there
would remain the question on what principle are the rates to
be framed? Are they to be according to equal mileage, or,
if not, in what other manner? What better mode can be
suggested than the past practice, which, as has been shewn,
has been beneficial to the community? Nor is it easy to
understand how any Court could fix all the incalculable
number of rates, and hear and determine all the practical
questions certain to arise. Even if a trifling proportion of
the rates were fixed in this manner, and the task in those
cases were performed, with reference to all the many
circumstances now governing rates, complications and
difficulties must arise, and the Court would be placed in
a position of great, if not insurmountable, difficulty. So
many anomalies must be authorised that it would be
impracticable for the Court to decide consistently with
precedents. In all probability the control would either
become nominal, or the whole system would have to be
recast. Nor must the serious loss of time by the staff of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
railways in attending to such inquiries, and the consequent
diminution of the efficiency of their work in the actual
regulation and conduct of railway traffic be lost sight of.
The costliness of inquiries before such a Court is a secondary,
but not an unimportant, matter. In the hope of obtaining
reduced rates, or of compelling a company to raise the rates
of a competitor in trade, or to raise the rates to and from
competing ports, some traders and merchants, separately or
combined, might risk the expense of applications to such
a Court.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
But the general interest could not be promoted
by the creation of any such arbitrary and anomalous Court.</p>

<p>Reference is often made to the experience of the United
States in regard to the supervision of railways as if it should
be a guide to us. There each State may legislate with
reference to the construction and regulation of its own railways.
At first everything was done to facilitate their
construction. They were proceeded with in advance of,
or concurrently with, immigration and settlement. Many
States have made large grants of land to railway companies.
In some States a few individuals, from five upwards, may
form themselves into a railway company, and under general
laws construct railways between any two places, regardless of
the wishes of others and the considerations which here form
the subject of Parliamentary inquiry. No scale of maximum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
rates, as a rule, governs the charges for conveyance; and great
variations in them are in fact made. Only, however, in recent
times, when railways have become numerous and their
extension is not so urgently needed, have State Legislatures
interfered with their management.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The expediency of establishing maximum rates has
been discussed in some States. But another course has also
been tried; Commissioners have been appointed for the
purpose of fixing reasonable charges. Where maximum
rates have been fixed, in no case, so far as can be ascertained,
have the Legislature altered, or the Commissioners interfered
with the powers conferred if the rates charged are within
such maximum. Some of the Commissioners fixed rates on so
unremunerative a basis as to defeat their object and to prevent
the introduction of capital, and the construction of railways.
The result was that in one State after a trial of about two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
years, the law establishing such a tribunal was hastily
repealed.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>The rates charged in the United States are mainly
governed by competition with water carriage, or between the
companies themselves. Occasionally they are so reduced
over large districts as to be totally unremunerative. As soon,
however, as the struggle between competitors is ended, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
an arrangement is arrived at, the rates are suddenly raised.
The circumstances of England and the United States are so
unlike that, even were those tribunals suited to the latter,
no case would be made out for establishing here a Court
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
armed with such powers. Here railway companies can make
charges only within their statutory maxima; there, as a rule,
no statutory maxima, or prohibitions of undue preference,
similar to those enacted here, are known. Here no
municipalities have largely subscribed to the capital of
railways, no grants of public lands have been made to them,
as have been freely done there.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>To legislation in Continental countries as to the fixing
of rates, we only briefly refer; in Appendix III. are full
details as to the law on this subject of Prussia and the German
Empire. It may, however, be here observed that the
Prussian General Railway Law of 1838 provided for a
reduction of rates when the net profits exceeded 10 per cent.;
that the concessions to private companies stipulate for the
control of the Government over rates; but that, in recent
concessions, greater freedom is accorded to the companies,
which may, within certain maximum limits, modify rates at
pleasure. Such legislation is well worthy of attention; only
it may be suggested that it is not reasonable to pick out for
commendation this or that provision without regard to its
concomitants&mdash;to propose to adopt provisions to the disadvantage
of railways, and to ignore those which recompense them.</p>

<p>In Germany exist District Consultative Councils or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Conciliation Courts, which deal with all questions relating
to conveyance of goods on railways, and with the application
of existing tariffs and the introduction of new local
tariffs. It has been stated that those Councils or Courts are of
great practical utility. Whether this be so or not the circumstances
under which Conciliation Boards are appointed in
Germany are very dissimilar to those of the railways in this
country. Their constitution is peculiar; similar elements
do not exist here. These Boards are composed of
representatives of the Government as workers of the
railways and representatives of the traders as users
of them. Both, however&mdash;the nominees of the Government
and the traders&mdash;may be said to represent the owners (in
reality&mdash;the public) of 85 per cent. of the lines, who are
liable for any loss in working them. In this country
neither the Government nor the traders are the owners.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
Moreover, in Germany the representative of the Government
which controls the working of the railways, has, in
fact, the power of fixing any rate by his final decision, whatever
may be the views of the traders or the Conciliation
Boards. In the last resort the owner of the lines controls
the rates.</p>

<p>Were such Councils established here their duties would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
not be so light as those which fall to them in Germany.
There the questions to be considered must be few, the time
occupied in deciding them short, owing to there being practically
no competition, and to the great bulk of the rates being
based on a mileage scale. Much more complex questions
would arise here, much longer time must be taken up in
deciding them in England, where rates are adapted to all
the requirements of trade and competition in its many forms.</p>

<p>In Holland, Belgium, and France, railways have been
constructed with, in some cases, considerable financial assistance
from the Governments, and under concessions for
certain periods. Not unnaturally or unreasonably the
Governments have reserved the right to control the
rates and charges to be made while a concession is in
existence, or when it ends. It will be found, however, that
when there is power to reduce the rates before the expiration
of the concession, the State guarantees the dividend in the
event of loss arising from the compulsory reduction. Such
is the case in Holland. The Dutch Law (Article 29) provides
that reductions in the tariff can at all times be ordered by
the State. But if, in consequence of such reductions, the net
gain of the company be diminished, compensation is to be
paid out of the State Treasury, and any dispute as to
the amount of compensation is decided by a Court of Justice.
In no case, however, must the amount of compensation
raise the net profits of the year or years for which it is
demanded above 8 per cent. of the Company&#8217;s capital. Thus
the right to control rates is part and parcel of a system
wholly unlike our own. It exists in a country where the
State has helped to construct, and to a very large extent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
actually constructed, railways. It is alien to this country,
where capital for the whole of the railways has been
provided by private individuals, on the faith of the powers
to levy the tolls and rates fixed in their private Acts.</p>

<p>In the Railway and Canal Traffic Bill (1886) was also
embodied a proposal to the effect that any person who was
of opinion that a company was charging an unfair or unreasonable
rate might make a complaint to the Board of
Trade, who were to be entitled to call on the company for
an explanation and to appoint one of their officers, or a
competent person, to communicate with the company and
the complainant, and to endeavour to settle the difference
amicably between the parties. The Board of Trade were
from time to time to submit to Parliament reports of the
complaints so made, the results of their proceedings, and
such observations as they should think fit. The effect of this
provision would have been startling. Even where a rate was
within a company&#8217;s powers&mdash;although undue preference was
not alleged&mdash;at the instance of a trader desirous of obtaining a
reduced rate which had been refused by a company and
believing that either his own circumstances or those of other
traders entitled him to communicate with the Board of
Trade, the railway company would be called upon to prove
to the Board of Trade that the claim of the trader ought
not to be granted. It would be, in effect, litigation made
easy and cheap, whether the complaint was good or bad.
The President, Vice-President, Secretary, or Assistant-Secretary
of the Board of Trade could not spare the time
necessary to master the numerous difficult questions and
details as to the rates.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
Notwithstanding the great ability
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
with which that department is conducted, these officials
could not deal with such questions in the same way or
within the same time as the traders and the representatives
of the companies are able. The companies would probably
be burthened with correspondence and discussions on matters
already fully gone into in negotiation. The discussion would
be necessarily carried on through subordinates or nominees
of the Board of Trade, who, it is not presumptuous to say,
would be neither interested in, nor specially trained to
deal with, such questions. Suppose that the representatives
of the Board of Trade and the railway companies disagreed
as to the necessity or reasonableness of a reduction in rates,
the former would have no authority to compel the companies
to comply with their views. Would not the result probably
be a cry that Parliamentary powers should be conferred on
the Board of Trade to enforce their conclusions? Such a
policy would in the end place the railway companies of the
country, whose capital has entirely been raised by private
enterprise, in a worse position than the railway companies
in Holland where the State has done so much for them, or in
France, where it has guaranteed the dividends.</p>

<p>When we are invited to place in the hands of a tribunal
the control of the rates, it is expedient to note the
difficulties which the Railway Commissioners seem to have
felt in dealing with the various questions raised before them,
and the manner in which they have dealt with them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>In determining under the Traffic Act questions of
alleged undue preference, they have been obliged to express
their opinion on the reasonableness of particular rates. As
to the legal correctness of their decisions, nothing need here
be said; for the present purpose it may be assumed that
they are open to no legal exception, and we fully recognise
the ability and care which they manifest. Only their
economical effects are here considered. There would be no
difficulty in showing that they have acted upon principles,
so far as they have acted upon any, which have not merely
not been sanctioned, but have been condemned, by every
Royal Commission or Select Committee which has inquired
into the subject, and by almost every economist of eminence.
On the part of the Commissioners there have been&mdash;not unnaturally&mdash;some
waverings in opinion. But on the whole, they
appear to have attempted to frame rates according to cost of
service; and they appear not to admit that the existence of
competition is a reason for varying them. Now, in the first place
they apply&mdash;it may be added, necessarily apply&mdash;the cost of
service principle in an imperfect fashion. They deal only with
undue preference in regard to the same or very similar articles.
They do not say, what consistent adherence to the theory would
compel them to say, that a ton of coals and a ton of tin
ingots must be carried at much the same rate; they are
bound by the existing classification, which forbids this.
Occasionally their decisions are indeed curiously inconsistent
in many respects, as was probably inevitable, where they
were called upon to face the commercial results which would
have followed a too rigid adherence to some of the principles
by which they felt themselves bound.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
In the case of the <i>Nitshill and Lesmahagow Coal Company</i> v. <i>Caledonian
Railway Company</i>,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the defendant company claimed to charge
more for carrying cannel coal, which, it was alleged, cost
38s. a ton, than they charged for carrying splint, which cost
15s. 6d. On the principle on which the classifications in
most special Acts were framed, this would be reasonable; the
more valuable article could bear more, and ought to pay
more. But the Railway Commissioners decided differently.
&#8220;As the quality of coal does not affect the cost of carriage
to the railway company,&#8221; they said, &#8220;we are of opinion that
the two kinds of coal ought to receive the same treatment.&#8221;
If this principle had been carried out since the beginning of
railways, if rates had been settled without regard to the value
of merchandise, the prosperity of many districts and industries
would never have been developed. In the second place, the cost
of carriage is, inevitably, sometimes guessed at rather than
calculated. We have already stated the nice calculations
which must be entered into in order to determine the exact
cost of carriage; calculations in which it is practically
impossible to attain accuracy. Many elements in cost, the
Commissioners cannot accurately measure; the data do not
exist. In the third place, the effect of their later decisions
is to exclude, practically, if not theoretically, competition
from the considerations to be taken into account. This is, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
only for the reasons already stated, contrary to sound commercial
principles; it is contrary to the language of the
early decisions of the Court of Common Pleas, which distinctly
recognised competition as rightly taken into account
in fixing rates. In <i>Garton</i> v. <i>Bristol &amp; Exeter Railway Co.</i>
(1 N. &amp; M. 1859, p. 218), for example, the Court of
Common Pleas decided, among other reasons against the
validity of a certain charge, because, in the words of
Byles, J., &#8220;it is not shown that it is rendered
necessary for the purpose of meeting and overcoming
competition&#8221;.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
The early judgments of the Railway
Commissioners themselves recognised the right to take into
account the existence of competition. In <i>Foreman</i> v. <i>Great
Eastern Railway Co.</i>, decided in 1875 (2 N. &amp; M. 202), the
point in dispute was the validity of a scale of charges for the
carriage of coal from Peterborough to Norwich and Great
Yarmouth and intermediate stations. The Great Eastern
Company were alleged to give an undue preference to coal
consigned to such stations, as compared with the carriage of
sea-borne coal from Great Yarmouth to Norwich and the
stations between it and Peterborough. The Commissioners
observed: &#8220;Nor does the Traffic Act prevent a railway company
from having special rates of charges to a terminus to which
traffic can be carried by other routes, or other modes of carriage
with which theirs is in competition,&#8221; a dictum inconsistent
with the view &#8220;that cost of service is the necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
measure of rates.&#8221; In a case decided the same year, <i>Thompson</i>
v. <i>London and North Western Railway Co.</i>, 2 N. &amp; M.
(1875) 115, the Commissioners speak dubiously. They
observe with respect to the argument that &#8220;the Traffic Act
prohibits only undue advantages, and that an advantage
given by a railway company to obtain traffic for which it
competes with another railway company is not undue&#8221;
(p. 120). &#8220;Such a proposition cannot, in our opinion, be laid
down unreservedly. It may be true in certain circumstances;
it would not be so in others, and what degree of favour can
be lawfully shown to some person to the prejudice of others
under the pressure of competition can only be decided in any
case that arises by reference to its special circumstances.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
In still later judgments there is a faint recognition of the fact
that the existence of competition ought to be taken into
account; <i>e.g.</i>, in <i>Richardson</i> v. <i>Midland Railway Company</i>,
decided in 1881 (4 N. and M. 1) the Commissioners say: &#8220;The
difference (between the Burton and Newark rates) or part of
it, may possibly be required by the route from the same
district, not being the same all the way to the two places, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
by the separate portions of line passed over being more
costly to work or construct in the one case than in the other;
or, again, may be required by a competition for the conveyance
of the particular traffic between the two termini, existing
in one case but not in the other. They proceed to speak
of &#8220;due allowance for such causes of difference,&#8221; which
implies that allowance must be made for both of such causes.
But in the <i>Broughton Coal Company&#8217;s</i> case (4 N. and M.
p. 191, 1883) the Commissioners use somewhat different
language. They observe that &#8220;if goods of the same kind are
carried to the same destination over the same railway for
distances that are not the same, and the gross charge from
the intermediate distance is as great as from the more distant
one, there is a preference of one traffic over the other within
the meaning of the Traffic Act of 1854; and that it is not
sufficient to rebut this presumption to show that the charge
for the longer distance has been reduced to meet a competition
from another route.&#8221; Lately the Commissioners have,
to say the least, lost sight of the element of competition in
determining rates; and in all the applications to them, there
is no clear instance in which they have found the circumstances
in which it ought, in their opinion, to operate.</p>

<p>Among the multifarious complaints against railway
companies is one to the effect that companies, instead of
competing with and underbidding each other, combine to
charge equal rates. This is an illustration of the curious
inconsistencies of some of those who criticise the working
of railways. Such a practice would be, as will be
seen in the next chapter, opposed to the ideas of others
who urge that rates should be based on scientific and
uniform principles. Such competition, too, would inevitably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
lead to valid grounds for complaints, in the opinion of
others, of undue preference in contravention of the Railway
and Canal Traffic Act of 1854. The fact is, the practice
has been tried and abandoned. In the days of road carriers,
competition in quoting low rates generally ended in the
submission or ruin of one of the parties. Here, and in the
United States, experience shews that all such competition on
the part of railways must end in combination. However
severe the contest may be, and however great the losses in
carrying it on, each of the railways continues to exist;
they do not disappear like private traders engaged in a
disastrous war of competition; and in the end they come to
terms. In thus acting, they only do what is done in other
industries. In the principal trades of the country are
associations which arrange the prices of their products.
Colliery proprietors, for example, agree as to the price of coal.
Although the hardware merchants seldom vary their price
lists, they agree from time to time as to the rate of discount
to be allowed. The steel rail manufacturers of Germany,
Belgium, England, and Scotland, had recently an arrangement
regulating, if not the proportion to be produced by
each country and district, the price at which rails were to be sold.

<h2>SECTION XVI.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">RAILWAY AMALGAMATION.</span></h2>

<p>We now come to a class of criticisms and proposals
wholly different from those which have hitherto been considered.
In the report by Sir Bernhard Samuelson (page 22)
is a recommendation that railway companies should either
amalgamate, or make agreements between themselves,
for the division of the receipts from competitive traffic,
so as to reduce the working expenses.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
Probably for the first time has this suggestion come from such
a quarter. Manifestly it is beginning to be understood that undue
competition between railways is injurious to the companies
without being beneficial to the public, and that, in the
interests of both, it should be moderated.</p>

<p>Hitherto, the public and Parliament have looked with
jealousy on arrangements between railway companies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
intended to lessen the waste caused by undue competition.
The statements so often put forward by companies that
the expenditure of capital in the construction and working
of unnecessary competing lines is not beneficial to the
public, have been disregarded. Any scheme which professed
to meet &#8220;public requirements,&#8221; and promised multiplication
of trains and the carriage of railway traffic at a high
rate of speed, has met with favour in and out of Parliament.</p>

<p>Whether the particular line could only be worked at
undue cost, or could yield a proper or, indeed, any return
upon the capital to be expended, has rarely been considered.
The Legislature has fostered new schemes, and has favoured
competition, not economy; it has not recognised how much
interested the public were in the prudent expenditure of
capital on railways. Had the reports prepared under the
guidance of Lord Dalhousie, in order that railways might
be constructed according to a definite plan, been acted upon,
or had he been able to carry out here his ideas as to
railway extension, as he did in India, the rapid growth of
railways might have been retarded.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
But, undoubtedly, the want of any plan has entailed the outlay of a
much larger amount of capital than would otherwise have been required.
Upon this excess, interest, if it can be earned, is paid;
a fact not to be overlooked by those who now desire
that the companies should reduce their rates. Such
errors are repeated. Even in recent years Parliamentary
Committees have authorised on the most trifling grounds
new competing lines. True, they expressed no opinion as to
the success of such schemes. But it must have been known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
that, if the capital were subscribed, it must come from people
who were under the impression that only schemes of substantial
value would be authorised by Parliament.</p>

<p>Of the many schemes of this description, two or three
illustrations may be given. Within the last 13 years, authority
was obtained to construct a local line for the accommodation
of a sparsely inhabited agricultural district. In this
form it was favoured by the companies in whose district
it was. The prospect of a return on the capital,
however, was so small that comparatively little money could
be raised. A scheme was, therefore, got up for obtaining
Parliamentary powers to extend the line on the plea that it
would thus become a through competitive line connecting
two important existing systems; a scheme which quite ignored
the fact that the two systems had already a means of communication,
which it was their interest and desire to develop
to the utmost against any hostile scheme. A large
portion of the capital was procured on the faith of
statements contained in carefully framed prospectuses,
for the issue of which the financiers were paid £60,000.
A considerable portion of the capital came from persons
residing in remote parts of the country. Some money
was borrowed for a time at the rate of 16 per cent.
per annum. Although about £1,200,000 in cash and
paper has been expended, the receipts do not cover the
working expenses, including the rent of stations and
expenses of junctions; the line must be imperfectly worked;
and of course not a farthing of interest or dividend can be
paid on any portion of the capital.</p>

<p>A second illustration may be given. About twenty-five
years ago a branch railway of 6 miles in length was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
promoted and sanctioned by Parliament as part of a line to
compete with an existing railway. The original cost was estimated
at £42,000, and the total amount of capital authorised
was £60,000. Not until 20 years after the Act was obtained
was the line opened for traffic. During this period no fewer
than eleven applications for increased capital or other powers
were made to Parliament; and three schemes of arrangement
were entered into with creditors and confirmed by the
Chancery Court. The total capital expended has been upwards
of £157,000, of which 44 per cent. has been raised by
loans, 46 per cent. by preference shares, and 10 per cent. only
by ordinary stock. What need there was of the line may be
inferred from the fact that, although it has now been open
for some five years, the gross receipts are not sufficient even
to pay the locomotive expenses.</p>

<p>One more case may be mentioned. An application was
made to Parliament for powers to construct a line about 7
miles in length, which was estimated to cost not far short of
£120,000. After four years a further application was made
for extension of time and for power to raise more than half
the share capital by the issue of preference stock and to
pay interest out of capital. It was then given in evidence
that upwards of one-fourth of the estimated cost of the line
had already been expended, although no works had been constructed,
and only £1,000 paid towards the acquisition of land.</p>

<p>In such cases the diversion of traffic from existing
railways usefully serving the public, the loss of interest on
the outlay if the line is in the end purchased by them,
and the expense of working it, are so much dead weight
which the railway system has to bear. Thus the companies
are so much less able to reduce rates.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Many similar cases could be stated. Notwithstanding the
absorption of this class of schemes, there is still upwards of
£61,000,000 of capital which has paid no dividend at all.
An inquiry into the promotion and construction of many of
the railways authorised during the last 25 years, would
probably bring to light facts as startling as those elicited by
the Foreign Loans Committee. The established companies
oppose such schemes. But their opposition is generally looked
upon as arising solely from selfish objects. They are told
that it is not their money which is to be expended, and that
though they may have a nominal, they have no substantial,
right to oppose. It is a common observation that, if a new
line afford accommodation for a part of the traffic carried
by the opposing company, it will be useful to the public, and
that if it will not carry any such traffic the objections of the
opposing company are groundless. Such arguments succeed;
the Bill is passed; and what happens? From long
experience the existing companies know that nearly all the
schemes which are at first brought out as independent
competing lines will sooner or later be pressing to be
worked or leased, or be in the market, and that the promoters
of any of them not taken over, will be continually
making applications to Parliament or to the Railway Commissioners,
posing, not as an aggressive, but as an ill-used
company, and harassing its neighbours with a view to be
purchased or to levy blackmail.</p>

<p>The present position of railways is largely due to the
action of Parliament and to the public, though some blame
is no doubt attributable to the companies themselves. A
great improvement has taken place in the relations of the
companies, and in the conduct of railways in recent years.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
But there has been too much readiness, indeed anxiety, to
invade districts accommodated by neighbouring companies.
In the working of their lines exaggerated importance is too
often given to competition without regard to its utility.
Frequently passenger trains are run without sufficient
regard to whether or not they are fairly remunerative.
Wagons containing only a small quantity of goods are
often sent long distances at little profit, if not at a
loss. Goods trains are run at an excessive speed, and therefore
do not and cannot carry such remunerative loads as
in other countries, notwithstanding some of the undoubtedly
low rates charged there. So-called &#8220;concessions,&#8221; not
really essential, are made to trading or other interests, when
it would be better that the companies should earn on the
traffic a reasonable income to go into the pockets of the
shareholders, or be expended, as suggested by Sir Bernhard
Samuelson, in improved accommodation.</p>

<p>While there has been too much proneness to favour
competing schemes, there has been an unreasonable jealousy
of agreements between companies. Traces of the jealousy
with which Parliament has regarded agreements between
companies, even for merely working branches in extension
of parent lines, are shewn by the provision that agreements
shall be reviewed every ten years. It also appears in the
views of the Railway Commissioners as expressed in section 6
of their twelfth report (1885). They state that it is
the practice of some companies to get such agreements
confirmed by means of a schedule to their private Bills, which
gives the public no opportunity of knowing what those
agreements are about, and that the agreements are confirmed,
either for long terms, or in perpetuity, without any provision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
for a periodical revision in the interests of the public. And
yet it is not known that the public have derived any advantages
from the periodical revision of agreements for working
branch lines, and whenever application has been made to
Parliament for absorbing a branch line it has been authorised
without any difficulty.</p>

<p>In the last session of Parliament, the Midland Company
applied for power to enter into, and carry into effect,
agreements with certain other railway companies with respect
to the provision of joint terminal accommodation at towns
and stations on their respective systems; the alteration and
enlargement of existing stations for joint purposes; the
providing at joint expense of train services between towns
and places served by their respective systems, and of
locomotive engines and stock for such joint trains; the
appointment of joint staff and the fixing of rates, fares and
charges in respect of traffic using such joint stations, or
carried by such joint trains, and the division of the receipts
therefrom. Any agreements made under these powers were
to be subject to the approval of the Board of Trade. With the
present view held by Parliament and by a section of the
traders as to railways, it is, however, questionable whether
such agreements would be confirmed, except on terms
which it would be impossible for the companies to accept.</p>

<p>In this country&mdash;which is unlike the United States in
this respect&mdash;agreements to charge equal rates for competitive
traffic have been, on the whole, adhered to. Arrangements
for the division of such traffic are therefore not so much
required here as there. The great desiderata of the companies
are the limitation of competition within reasonable bounds,
stopping the waste which it now causes, and fully affording to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
each other and to the public and traffic all practicable facilities
and accommodation.</p>

<p>Agreements for the division of traffic, or for &#8220;pooling,&#8221; as
they are termed in the United States and Canada, are not unknown
in this country. Some have been sanctioned by Parliament;
others have been made between the companies without
any express Parliamentary authority, and have been carried
out. For instance, Mr. Gladstone made, in 1851, an award
apportioning, for a period of five years, the receipts for traffic
carried between, London, York, Leeds, Sheffield, and several
other places, between the Great Northern, and London and
North Western, and Midland Railways. In the year 1857
he made a further award determining, for a period of fourteen
years, the proportions in which the proceeds from the
passenger and goods traffic between the same and other
places, including Hull, Halifax, Bradford, &amp;c., were to be
divided between these companies and the Manchester, Sheffield
and Lincolnshire Company.</p>

<p>Parliament has sanctioned agreements for the division
of traffic receipts between the South Eastern and London
Chatham and Dover, and between the London Brighton
and South Coast and South Eastern Companies. But it is
more than doubtful whether the parties to these agreements
have derived all the advantages which, consistently with the
interests of the public, they might have obtained.</p>

<p>It is well known that nowhere on the Continent has the
construction of competing lines been carried out to the same
extent as in this country; it is one of the great permanent
advantages possessed by Continental railways.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
In France the companies have districts within which they exclusively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
afford railway accommodation. The Government recognise
and sanction agreements between the companies for the
prevention of undue competition where it inevitably arises,
and for an apportionment of the receipts from competitive
traffic. The following is an instance:&mdash;An agreement made
31st March, 1885, between the &#8220;Western of France Railway
and the Orleans Railway Companies, provided that the
receipts in respect of traffic carried between Paris and
Angers, Nantes, Montoir, St. Nazaire, Redon and stations
beyond, after deducting taxes (&#8220;Impôts&#8221;) and terminals
should be apportioned thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Traffic between Paris and Redon and stations beyond as far as
Plaermel and Pontivy&mdash;</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;55 per cent. proportion to the Western Company.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;45&nbsp;&emsp;&#8221;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#8221;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#8221;&emsp;&nbsp;Orleans Company.</p>


<p>2. Traffic carried between Paris and Angers, Nantes, Montoir, St. Nazaire, and branches
leading out of the latter two stations, as well as Pont Chateau, by whatever route the
traffic may have been carried&mdash;</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;49 per cent. proportion to the Western Company.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;51&nbsp;&emsp;&#8221;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#8221;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&#8221;&emsp;&nbsp;Orleans Company.</p>

<p>3. Traffic carried between Paris and stations beyond Angers or Martre d&#8217;Ecole
on the States Railway&mdash;</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;230/304 to the Western Company.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;74/304&emsp;&nbsp;&#8221;&emsp;&emsp;Orleans&emsp;&emsp;&#8221;</p>

<p>In Belgium there is practically no such competition
as exists in this country. The Government have had to face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
the difficult questions respecting it: they have solved
them in a manner different from that adopted here. They
have entered into an agreement for the division of competitive
traffic between the State railways and the Grand
Central Belge. Under this arrangement the route over
which the traffic is conveyed is credited with the whole of
the terminals, and 50 per cent. of the carrying receipts.
The remaining 50 per cent. is apportioned between the
two competing routes on the following basis, viz:&mdash;</p>

<p>Each route is credited with 25 per cent. if the mileage is equal.</p>

<p>The longest route is credited with</p>

</table>

<p class="space-above1">The route selected by either the State railways
or the Grand Central Belge must not exceed the distance by
the shortest route by more than 25 per cent.; above which
limit all competition ceases.</p>

<p>In Germany exist arrangements practically amounting
to a division of traffic. For instance, the shortest route
from Elberfeld to Bâle is viâ Coblenz-Strasburg. The
traffic to Bâle is carried every alternate month by the Right
Rhenish route over the Badisch State railway, and by the
Left Rhenish route over the Alsace-Lorraine railways.
As regards traffic with Austria-Hungary arrangements are
made which ensure to each line a certain percentage. In
the event of the returns showing that one company have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
not carried their fixed share, they are entitled to a money
compensation.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the suggestion of Sir B. Samuelson that
reductions should be made in the expenses of working railways,
and that undue competition should be avoided by
arrangements between the companies, is important and well
worthy of consideration. To commerce generally, and to the
traders using railways, it might clearly be advantageous.
It may, however, be premature to expect that at present such
agreements as he suggests would be sanctioned by Parliament,
except upon onerous conditions. If such agreements
were favourably regarded by the representatives of commerce
and agriculture in Parliament, the companies would more
willingly enter into them. In many cases greater economy
and improved working would undoubtedly result, and there
is no reason why such arrangements should not be made
beneficial to the public as well as fair to the railway companies.

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>SECTION XVI.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">RAILWAYS AND CANALS.</span></h2>

<p>Great stress is laid on the importance of canals. Railway
companies have been accused of preventing them from
competing with railways, of improperly getting possession
of them, not maintaining them, and so acting as to force
the traffic on to their lines. In Parliament and elsewhere
they have been charged with purchasing canals and then
deliberately killing them, either by ceasing to keep them
in repair or by reducing rates upon their lines to a point
which makes competition by the canals impossible. These
assertions have been made before Royal Commissions and
Select Committees. In no official report or other authoritative
document, however, have they been declared proved; and it
is submitted that facts do not warrant them. Not to the
artifices of railway companies, but to altered conditions
of trade is due, in the main, the inability of many canals to
hold their own against railways. The necessity for rapid
transit, the disinclination to keep large stocks, the growth
of the practice of applying to the producer or manufacturer
as orders come in, and as occasion requires, and the low rates
by railway for articles which canals can convey, have all
been unfavourable to the latter. It is not unimportant to
note that no Commission or Committee has been able to
point out any mode in which the decline of canal traffic&mdash;&#8220;the
creeping paralysis of our inland waterways&#8221;&mdash;could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
arrested. We may, too, incidentally note the considerable
diversity of opinion as to the importance of canals generally.
Some complain that great injury has been done to the trading
community by the absorption of the canals by railway
companies.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
Others will have it that too much importance
is attached to canals; they have been even described as
&#8220;<i>those wretched little waterways which could never compete
successfully with the great railway companies</i>.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>In 1883, a Committee was appointed by Parliament to
enquire into the condition and the position of the canals and
internal navigation of the country, to report thereupon, and
to make such recommendations as might appear necessary.
It sat during the greater part of the Session. Many charges
were made against railway companies which owned canals.
They could not be answered in that Session for want of
time. So little importance seems to have been attached to
them or indeed to the subject of canals, that the Committee
was not re-appointed in the following Session. No report
was therefore ever made.</p>

<p>The subject affords a valuable illustration of the railway
legislation in this country, and of the prejudice and misapprehension
which exist in some quarters as to the conduct
of railway companies. Far from there being an inordinate
desire to absorb canals, it will appear that those which belong
to railway companies have, as a rule, been forced upon them,
either to remove the opposition of the canal companies, or as
a condition of railway Bills being passed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us give an instance of the treatment which the
promoters of railways, when opposed by the representatives
of waterways, have received at the hands of Parliament. In
respect of the Severn navigation, the Great Western Company
are at the present time under a heavy liability. This
liability was forced upon their predecessors, the Oxford,
Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway Company, when
applying for powers to construct their railway, which did
not really compete with the navigation to any serious extent,
if at all. Clause 94 of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton
Railway Act of 1845 recites that the Severn Commissioners
had raised the sum of £180,000 upon the
security of the tolls on the Severn navigation, in the
expectation that those tolls would reach the sum of £14,000
a year. It provides that the Great Western and the Oxford,
Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway Companies should,
from the opening of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton
Railway for traffic between Worcester and
Wolverhampton, and so long as the principal moneys raised
by the Severn Commissioners, or interest thereon, remained
due, make up to the Severn Commissioners any deficiency
between the actual amount of the tolls for any year, and
the sum of £14,000. The Great Western Company do not
possess or even control the navigation. Yet this liability
was forced on the promoters as a condition of obtaining
their Bill; and in respect of it the Great Western Company
actually now pay between £6,000 and £7,000 per annum!</p>

<p>How much truth there is in the allegation that the
canals owned by railway companies are not properly maintained
by these companies, but that on the contrary the
railway companies obstruct the trade on them, may be shown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
by the case of the Kennet and Avon canal, which is also
the property of the Great Western Company.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>This canal was authorised by an Act of 1794. The
canal is between Newbury and Bath, a distance of
57 miles. But the water communication is extended beyond
Newbury on the one side to Reading by means of the River
Kennet, and from Bath to near Bristol on the other side
by means of the River Avon. The total navigable distance
between the points named is 86&frac12; miles. This canal is joined
by the Wilts and Berks canal (which is connected with the
Thames by the Thames and Severn canal) and the
Somersetshire Coal canal. Thus the Kennet and Avon
canal forms part of an extensive system of waterways,
by communicating direct with the Thames on the one hand
and the Severn on the other. The total cost of the Kennet
and Avon canal was £1,011,589. It was opened in 1810,
from which date, up to 1813, no separate accounts of capital
and revenue were kept. But the returns from 1813 show that
the receipts of the canal gradually increased from £22,075
gross and £11,843 net in 1813 to £58,820 gross and £39,113
net in 1840. The opening of the Great Western Company&#8217;s
line between Reading and Bath in 1840-41 seriously affected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the canal revenue. The canal company applied to
Parliament for powers to construct a railway alongside
their canal. Failing in that project, they in 1848 availed
themselves of the powers of the General Canal Act, and
entered upon the carrying business, from which, however,
they derived little profit. In fact the first year was
the only year when the revenue derived from the carrying
business exceeded the expenses. The opening of the line of
railway between Chippenham and Trowbridge in 1848-50
still further injured the canal traffic. The canal company
offered to transfer their undertaking to the Great Western
Company; and the terms for such transfer were agreed
and approved by Parliament in 1852. In sanctioning the
arrangement, Parliament, however, imposed upon the Great
Western Company the condition that, if at any time the
canal tolls were complained of as, in comparison with those
of the railway, prejudicially affecting traders on the canal,
the Board of Trade should make such regulations and fix
such tolls as they might think fit. In 1867-1868 the traders
using the canal memorialized the Board of Trade to reduce
the tolls. An Arbitrator, who was appointed, reported in
favour of a reduction, which was accordingly carried out.
The tolls thus fixed were charged up to 1877, when the
traders again memorialized the Board of Trade. The
matter was referred to the Railway Commissioners, before
whom it was given in evidence that if further reductions
were made on certain articles constituting the chief
trade of the canal, the traffic would materially increase.
The Railway Commissioners thereupon reduced the tolls
upon those articles from 1d. per ton per mile with a maximum
of 6s., to 1/2d. per ton per mile with a maximum, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
the whole distance of 86&frac12; miles, of 2s. But the statements
of the traders that an increase of the traffic would follow
upon a reduction of the tolls have been found to be entirely
baseless. Notwithstanding this great reduction, the traffic
had fallen from 159,190 tons in 1876, to 125,807 in 1885.</p>

<p>The gross receipts in the year 1840 were, as
already stated, £58,820; in 1848 they had fallen to
£33,205; in 1852, when the canal was taken over by the
Great Western Company, to £24,291, and in 1885 to
£4,237. The canal has been maintained in an efficient
state of repair by the Great Western Company, in accordance
with the obligation imposed upon them by their Act of
1852, and the navigation has been always kept open.
Notwithstanding the large reductions in the tolls, the traffic
has year by year diminished, until in 1885 the expenses
considerably exceeded the receipts, without taking into account
the interest (between £7,000 and £8,000 a year) which the
company have to pay upon the capital expended in acquiring
the canal undertaking. These are weighty facts. Although
the Great Western Company purchased the Kennet and
Avon canal, pay interest on the purchase money, and
maintain it, and although they are deprived of the power to
fix the tolls upon the canal, and have had to submit to two
reductions&mdash;the maximum under the latter arrangement
being for the whole length of the canal little more than one
farthing per ton per mile in respect of any description of
goods&mdash;the traffic has continued to fall off. The tolls do not
yield sufficient to pay the salaries and wages of the working
staff, or even the actual cost of the labour and materials
necessary for maintenance and repairs.</p>

<p>The foregoing illustration, may help to correct the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
statements which have been made as to the conduct of
railway companies in the capacity of owners or workers
of canals. Not only the Kennet and Avon canal, but, it
is probable, all the other canals which have been taken
over by the Great Western Company, must have been closed
years ago if they had remained in the possession of the canal
companies. The public have, in fact, had the opportunity
of availing themselves of the water carriage when it was to
their interest to do so, just because the railway company
took over the canals and kept them in working order.</p>

<p>Though every railway company owning or managing
a canal may be compelled under the Section cited on page 193
to keep it in repair, only one application for that purpose has
been made to the Railway Commissioners. This is scarcely
consistent with the loose, unverified accusations as to the
shortcomings of railway companies. Besides, it is not true
that the whole canal system has passed under the influence of
railways. Of the 3,029 miles of canals in Great Britain,
1,592&frac12; miles are owned or managed by other than railway
companies.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
An examination of the map prepared by Mr.
Abernethy, C.E., for the Select Committee of 1883, shows,
that south of a line passing through Worcester, Birmingham,
Nottingham and Hull, there is scarcely a canal of any importance,
with the exception of the Kennet and Avon canal, between Bath and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Reading, permanently, temporarily, or partially in the hands
of a railway company.</p>

<p>The fact appears to be that canals flourish only where
certain conditions exist. Where a large traffic can be conveyed
in full boatloads; where the country is flat, and there
are consequently few locks; where large vessels propelled by
steam can be used; where works are so situated that
the cost of collection or delivery can be saved; in such
circumstances, canals are suitable for coal, chalk, cotton,
stone, bricks, pig-iron, round timber, grain, &amp;c., and such
like goods carried in large quantities, or for short distances.
They can, no doubt, when such conditions exist, be
beneficially used at a low cost for carriage; but for traffic
not large, or composed of a great variety of articles,
which have to be collected in small quantities from
different places, or to be distributed all over the country,
canals cannot successfully compete with railways. Want
of water in dry summers, interruptions from ice in winter,
and diversity of gauges in locks and tunnels&mdash;all matters
which add to cost&mdash;are great inconveniences, and grave
objections to water carriage. Often carriage by canal necessitates
the erection of warehouses for storing goods, which
is saved by the transit of traffic by rail. The speed and
despatch demanded by the modern necessities of trade have
tended to throw upon the railway more and more of the traffic
which formerly went by canals, as well as the increase in the
traffic of the country. In Staffordshire, canal boats meet
from all the principal towns such as Manchester, Liverpool,
and parts of Yorkshire in the North, and London and
Bristol in the South; <i>but no through traffic is exchanged</i>. All
the traffic of Staffordshire in iron, hardware, chains, anchors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
nails, &amp;c., outwards, and grain, timber, spelter, bone,
manures, &amp;c. inwards, requiring speed, is carried by railways.
Where the canal charges are equal to, or lower than, the
railway rates, the railways and canals divide the traffic.
Newly-opened collieries and works are now, as a rule, laid
out for loading into railway wagons, not into boats, because
railway stations and railway trucks give greater facilities for
distribution of coal to all parts of the country. No doubt
certain large canals&mdash;for example, the Aire and Calder,
Bridgwater, and the Leeds and Liverpool&mdash;can be profitably
worked in their exceptional circumstances, as they possess a
plentiful supply of water, and traverse a long stretch of
comparatively level country. Where such conditions exist
for distances of fifty to sixty miles, canals may compete
successfully for heavy traffic with railways.</p>

<p>Nor have the proprietors of canals done the utmost to
overcome inherent disadvantages. The existing inland
system, with only 7-feet locks, is inadequate. The canals
are too shallow; they are wasteful in the consumption of
water; and they cannot be worked economically. The cost
of working larger boats of 300 tons on suitable canals,
hauled by steam, and loaded and unloaded by the best
appliances of steam cranes would, of course, be much
less expensive than that of working the boats of, say 30
to 60 tons, now used.</p>

<p>The cost of haulage on the narrow canals is much in
excess of the cost of conveyance by rail, and the difference
remains,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
notwithstanding all efforts to improve the
canals; efforts which, to be really useful, it was estimated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
would cost about £12,000 a mile. Mr. F. Morton, a canal
carrier, stated that his firm lost from £100 to £150 per
boat, per year, on certain of their &#8220;Fly&#8221; or quick boats,
which were worked as an auxiliary to their general business
with a view to compete with the railways, and help to
retain that portion of the &#8220;Slow&#8221; traffic which
they still have.</p>

<p>In countries possessing a large network of canals and
other waterways&mdash;in France, Holland, and Germany (the
Rhine provinces) for example&mdash;and where railway accommodation
is not so complete as in this country, canals are
necessarily important channels of communication. In
France the waterways consist of&mdash;</p>

<p>Except 534 miles the whole of the mileage is the property
of the State, and canals have been artificially fostered by
it. According to a report prepared by M. Krantz, in
1872, and submitted to the Select Committee on Canals in
1883, the expenditure upon the waterways in France was on
that date £32,738,715 on canals, and £13,557,867 on rivers,
a total of £46,296,582, while the cost of maintenance for
the year was upwards of £336,000<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>.</p>

<p>In Belgium the aggregate length of the canals and
navigable rivers is 1,254 miles, seven-eighths of which
belong to the State. On a great portion no toll is charged;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
and on the remainder, sums varying from 3¼d. to 1s. 1d. per
ton per 100 miles.</p>

<p>In Holland there are nearly 3,000 miles of canals and
waterways, the former of which practically belong to the State.</p>

<p>If the explanation which has been given be not correct&mdash;if
the great obstacle to the success of canals in this country
be not their inferiority, as compared with railways, in the
carriage of goods to answer the needs of trade&mdash;why have
no new canals been made for some fourteen or fifteen years?
They cost much less per mile than railways, and their maintenance
expenses are not so heavy. That they are falling
into decay in this country when left in private hands, is due,
in the main, to the fact that this country is well supplied
with railway accommodation, and that for most kinds of
merchandise they are not such an efficient mode of transport
as railways.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>The chief complaints which have been discussed fall
under two heads; first, the statements expressed in many
forms that rates on the Continent are lower than rates here,
that this difference injures our trade, and that English
railway rates ought therefore, to be reduced; secondly, that
rates are based on no principle, that a scientific system ought
to be adopted, and that import, transit, and certain other
special rates, as the greatest anomalies, ought to be prohibited.
A few words remain to be said to summarise my arguments
as to each of these statements.</p>

<p>The facts and figures mentioned at pages 144-8, and elsewhere
have shown, it is hoped, that for instance, the exportation
of iron or coal&mdash;the articles more often mentioned in
the controversy&mdash;is not prejudiced by the railway rates
charged in England as compared with those charged abroad.
There has been, undoubtedly, some loss of trade in particular
markets. For instance, coal was formerly sent from this
country to Antwerp, Rotterdam, and Amsterdam. It is now
replaced by Belgian and German coal. Is this very surprising?
Is it reasonable to expect that colliery proprietors
on the Continent would not supply coal, or the
Governments, the proprietors of the railways, not
convey it at anything above cost price rather than allow
foreign coal to be imported, their collieries to stand idle,
and their people to be unemployed? Coal of superior quality
can be shipped at Newport and Cardiff at from 6½d. to 1s.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
per ton. What abatement could reasonably be expected
from rates based on such a very low scale? What effect, if
a reduction were made, could it have upon the alleged foreign
competition, and upon the depression in trade?</p>

<p>The prices of coal are low because of over production,
and undue competition between colliery owners. The extravagant
prices obtained by colliery proprietors in 1873-4
led to the opening of many new collieries in the South
Wales, Northern and Midland districts of England, as well
as in Germany and elsewhere. The result was to create a
capacity of output far beyond the demand&mdash;160,000,000
tons per annum now as compared with 127,000,000 tons in
1873. The desire which exists in every district for reductions
in railway rates is not so much to meet foreign, as
home competition; the strength of that desire is ascribable
to the activity and intensity of the latter competition.</p>

<p>In regard to export trade, the inland producers of
manufactured goods must be at a disadvantage as compared
with their rivals on the sea coast. But no complaint that
the railway companies had diverted traffic from England
abroad by exorbitant rates was made out before the Railway
Rates Committee. The Royal Commission on the Depression
of Trade have heard much evidence to that effect, but they
have not thought it necessary to call upon the railway companies
for any reply. To very different causes&mdash;some of
them far reaching and deep&mdash;is due the depression which
interested persons would attribute on superficial grounds to
the operation of rates.</p>

<p>Upon the policies pursued by foreign Governments in
regard to the construction and working of railways, it is
unnecessary to pass any opinion. No trustworthy judgment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
is possible without fully considering all the
circumstances&mdash;especially the difficulties to be encountered
and the objects which the Governments had in view.
It is enough to point out how radically different are the
railway systems here and abroad&mdash;how much at variance are
the policies pursued by our Government and by those of
Continental States. Here the sole principle running through
railway legislation has been to depend upon private enterprise,
and to encourage competition between the companies.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
Parliament has afforded no assistance to them, except indeed
conferring the power to purchase, often on payment of
exorbitant prices, the necessary land. Even when property
of the State has been required by a railway company, the
Government have, as a rule, been as exacting in their terms
as any of the now maligned landowners, wholly different has
been the policy of Governments abroad. Not only have
railways been saved the payment of extravagant compensation
or legal expenses in obtaining powers to construct the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
railways or acquire property, but inasmuch as the public in
France did not, as in England, come forward to provide the
necessary capital, the State supplied large portions of the
capital of some railways, and contracted heavy obligations to
promote the construction of others. In Germany, the State is
responsible for the interest on the capital, the Government alone
bearing any loss arising from charging low rates or otherwise.
That also is the position of the Government in Belgium, which is
responsible to the extent of 71 per cent. of the railway system
in that country. The principles which have guided the
Belgian Government in fixing railway rates appear from the
extract from the report of the Debate to be found on page 115.
At an interview which M. Vandenpeereboom, the Belgian
Minister of Railways, Post and Telegraphs, was good enough
to grant the writer, this was confirmed. Asked &#8220;what had
been the object which the Government had in fixing the
tariff; whether they had in view the obtaining of a fair
interest on the outlay as a commercial undertaking, or
whether the object was to develop the resources of the
country, looking to a return on the outlay as a secondary
consideration,&#8221; M. Vandenpeereboom replied &#8220;<i>that the object
had been to develop the resources of the country</i>, and therefore
a return on the capital was not of primary importance.&#8221;
These fundamental differences cannot be disregarded; the
fruits of systems so radically dissimilar cannot be expected
to be the same.</p>

<p>If the State here, as in France, had provided without
charging interest towards the capital expended upon the railways
in this country, the same proportion as was so provided
by the State in France (say upwards of £200,000,000), and
guaranteed from 7 to 11 per cent. dividend on the remainder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
of the share capital; if it had, as in Holland, found three-fifths
(£480,880,000) of the total sum expended on British
railways, and accepted less than one per cent. interest upon
the advance, the railway companies in this country could
have afforded to carry at rates considerably lower than they
now carry. It would not have been unreasonable in that
case on the part of traders to have called on them to do so.</p>

<p>But the benefits, such as they are, of the Continental
system cannot be fairly claimed without bearing the cost.
Other countries, having in view advantages from railways,
have paid for them with public money, and are
prepared to pay still further for them at the expense of the
taxpayer; it would be an unreasonable and scarcely honest
policy to try to get indirectly the same rights and advantages
without payment.</p>

<p>Our Government have been called upon to reduce the
rates of the railway companies upon the complaint of traders
that they have to compete with French, German, and
Belgian traders, who are served by what, speaking generally,
may be termed &#8220;subsidised lines.&#8221; To such an application
the answer of the Government of this country, who have
hitherto declined to aid the sugar manufacturers in their
competition with those in France, supported though the
latter are by State bounties, cannot be doubtful. Nor
would purchase by the State remove all the differences
which have been mentioned. Some of them cannot
now be overcome. If the Government did purchase the
railways, and by reducing the accommodation to something
like that given on the Continent, were enabled to
diminish the working expenses; if they placed the railways
on the same footing as regards duties and taxes as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
Government lines in Germany, the fact would remain that
the railways in this country have cost from 45 to 120 per
cent. more than those on the Continent, and that in wages
alone there is a disparity which they would not be able
materially to alter.</p>

<p>The volume of trade in England, it may be said, is
greater in proportion to that of other countries; this should
be considered, it may be argued, as an equivalent for the
greater cost of construction and working of the railways.
The fact that the average dividend is only 4·02 per cent.&mdash;that
is, two-fifths of the dividend which in 1844 it was considered
the railways should pay&mdash;is one of several answers
to this contention.</p>

<p>A few remarks may be made with respect to the
second class of complaints&mdash;those which relate to the mode
of fixing rates.</p>

<p>The chief question is, What rates will at once yield a
fair return on the capital of railways and best accommodate
and develop the trade of the country? The early Acts
provided that they should be fixed according to mileage. This,
as we have seen, was altered by s. 90 of the Railway Clauses
Act 1845. Are railway companies no longer to carry out the
provision of that Act, and continue to charge rates &#8220;so as
to accommodate them to the circumstances of the traffic?&#8221;
That principle has guided them for forty years, and certainly
ought not to be altered without good cause and full
consideration. Instead of merely inveighing against the
present mode of fixing rates as unscientific, those who are
dissatisfied should explicitly state what mode they would
substitute, and make clear by full explanation that it would
be at once fair to the companies, and not injurious to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
trade of the country. To charge according to actual cost of
conveyance, or on a strictly mileage basis, has been shown to
be impracticable and impolitic. What other modes can be suggested?</p>

<p>If the mode of fixing rates adopted in France, Holland,
Belgium and Germany&mdash;systems which differ from each
other&mdash;are suited to those countries they would be inapplicable
here. In practice they have to be modified. In
Holland, for instance, the theory is mileage rates, but the
greater portion of the traffic conveyed by railways is, in fact,
carried on under special contracts wholly inconsistent with
the principle upon which the railway rate system is nominally
based, which, if imitated in this country, would afford continuous
occupation for the Railway Commissioners.</p>

<p>The main complaint against the English companies is
that they so charge differential rates as to encourage foreign
competition. The effect of these rates is apt to be overestimated
or misunderstood. The benefits which the manufacturers
derive from the low export rates&mdash;based upon
exactly the same principle&mdash;are entirely ignored. It may
be a matter of doubt whether it has been prudent on the
part of railway companies to consent to some of the import
rates complained of. Indeed, this doubt may be entertained,
even if there is no substantial grievance, and it may be desirable
that Parliament or the Board of Trade should
institute an inquiry into the subject, which affects not only
the interests of railway companies, agriculturists, and manufacturers,
but also those of consumers, steamboat proprietors,
merchants, and sea-ports.</p>

<p>No system of rates can be suggested, much less adopted,
which would satisfy the desires of all traders. When the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
recommendation of the Railway Rates Committee is carried
out&mdash;when one uniform classification is adopted over all the
railways, and the maximum rate clauses of the Companies
are consolidated and revised on the basis of their existing
powers&mdash;any difficulty in ascertaining whether the charges are
within the companies&#8217; powers will be removed. The reasonableness
of the charges for terminal services will be
determined by the Railway Commissioners.</p>

<p>Instead of the many scales of tolls now in force on all
large systems of railways&mdash;due to their being built up of
originally independent lines&mdash;one or at most two scales
of tolls will govern the entire systems of companies. By
this process a great improvement will be effected. Many
of the anomalies in the rates will be removed. But it
is to be hoped, in the interest of the trade of the country as
a whole, that no legislation affecting railways, while preserving
the existing provisions against undue preference, will
interfere with the right of the companies to charge, within
their maxima, differential rates such as the traffic will fairly
bear; a power which has enabled them to meet the requirements
of producers and consumers in varying circumstances.</p>

<p>These observations have not been written with a view to
prove that there is no scope for criticism in the management
of railways in this country, but are made with every desire
to comprehend and appreciate all reasonable objections. They
do not pretend to solve all difficulties of the railway problem;
but they may, at least, show the serious dangers which would
arise if some of the crude and popular proposals often put
forward were adopted, and may aid in arriving at a safe and equitable settlement.

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>APPENDIX I.<br /><span class="h_subtitle">COMPARISON BETWEEN ENGLISH AND FOREIGN RATES.</span></h2>

<p>The figures and facts which have been stated prove that,
as a rule, no fair, or even useful, comparison can be made between
rates per ton per mile on railways in England, and those
charged on railways in continental countries. A multitude of
circumstances&mdash;original cost of construction, difference in
gradients, nature of services performed, speed in transit, limited
liability of foreign companies, opportunities for getting full
loads, immunity from taxation&mdash;must all be taken into account
before a just comparison can be established.</p>

<p>But even assuming due regard is not given to these striking
differences the inference to the extent drawn by Sir B.
Samuelson is not accurate; the rates on the Continent are
not universally lower. Sir B. Samuelson&#8217;s report contains
many errors of detail; and some of them are worth noting,
because they are frequently repeated. Comparisons throughout
have been made without due regard to the conditions attaching
to the rates, or the different circumstances under which the
traffic is carried. We give a few instances of the errors; errors,
it may be observed, not merely in calculation but in the very
bases of the comparison.</p>

<p>An effort has been made to reduce the English rates (which
include collection and delivery) to station to station rates,
with the object of comparing them with similar rates in other
countries. But many of the deductions are inaccurate and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>
misleading. Instead of adding to the continental station to
station rates the charges for cartage, which in Brussels is 4s.
per ton, and in other Belgian towns about 2s. 5d. at each end,
Sir B. Samuelson has apparently made arbitrary deductions of
sums varying from 3d. and 4d. to 1s. and 2s. per ton for cartage
from British rates. These are manifestly insufficient deductions.
It is impossible that services could be performed for such sums,
especially in London. We cite a few illustrations of this class
of errors.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
For <span class="smcap">Iron Wire</span> packed from Birmingham to London the rate
is shown as 24s. 4d. per ton; the actual rate is 28s. 4d. per ton,
including collection and delivery. Apparently 4s. per ton has been
deducted for cartage at both ends; that is <i>merely 2s. per ton</i>
for cartage in London, although the cost of delivery in such a city
as Brussels would be 4s. per ton.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
Similar remarks apply to the rates for unpacked iron wire from
Birmingham to London and Manchester, which have been treated in the
same way.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<span class="smcap">Cotton Goods</span> from Manchester to Oxford.&mdash;The rate shewn
on page 32 is 42s. per ton, station to station; the correct rate,
including collection and delivery, being 42s. 6d. per ton, so that
6d. per ton, <i>or 3d. per ton only at each end</i>, has been apparently
allowed for collection and delivery.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<span class="smcap">Woollen, Worsted and Stuff Goods</span> from Bradford (Yorks) to
Norwich.&mdash;The rate shown on page 32 is 41s. per ton, station to
station, while the correct rate, including collection and delivery,
is 41s. 8d. per ton; 8d. per ton being apparently allowed in this
case for the two services of collection and delivery.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<span class="smcap">General Machinery</span> from Leeds to Newcastle.&mdash;The export rate

<p>These errors make many of the comparisons valueless.</p>

<p>A still graver error has been repeatedly committed.
Notwithstanding the remark (page 19) that the cost of collection
and delivery has been deducted, Sir B. Samuelson has in numerous
cases assumed British rates, which include either collection or
delivery, and in some cases both those services, to be station to
station rates, and compared them as such with station to station
rates on the foreign lines. Here are a few examples of this
class of mistakes.</p>

<p class="space-above1">An unfortunate omission may be mentioned. In some cases
there are alternative rates on the English railways, <i>i.e.</i>, a higher
rate when the company undertakes the risk of conveyance, and a lower
rate when the risk is borne by the owner. In no single instance
has Sir B. Samuelson taken in his comparisons the lower owner&#8217;s
risk rate chargeable at the option of the consignor. Yet in
Holland, for instance, the goods are carried practically at the
risk of the owner. On some goods no compensation for damage
or delay is payable, while on the others the compensation is
limited, in some cases, to simply a return of a portion, or, at
the utmost, the whole of the freight. We give a few examples
of this class of errors.

<p class="space-above1">These are not the only misleading omissions;
it is incumbent to mention others not less important.</p>

<p>In Holland bulky articles pay double the fast goods or
ordinary goods rates, or as for a minimum truckload of 5,000
or 10,000 kilogrammes respectively. An actual instance of a
consignment from Rotterdam to Munich will illustrate the
system:&mdash;2 machines and 7 packages of appurtenances, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
actual weight of which was 6,762 kilogrammes (6 tons 13 cwt.)
were charged as for 10,000 kilogrammes (9 tons 16 cwt. 3 qrs.)
under the conditions of special tariff No. 3. This special
rate is ignored.</p>

<p>In almost every instance, Sir B. Samuelson has taken the
lowest rates in Germany, Belgium and Holland, which are
applicable only to full truckloads of 5 and 10 tons, and in some
cases, viz., Belgium, to a minimum weight of 8 cwt. These he
has used for the purpose of comparison with English rates for
any quantities over 500 lbs.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
The rate for hardware from Birmingham to Newcastle for export&mdash;206
miles&mdash;is 27s. 6d. per ton, including collection and delivery, but
it is shewn as 25s. 6d. per ton, station to station, overlooking
the special owner&#8217;s risk rate of 25s. per ton, which also includes
collection and delivery. The German rate for the same distance (331
kilometres) is incorrectly given as 18s. 7d. per ton; the lowest
station to station rate is 19s. per ton for full truckloads of
not less than 5 tons, the rate for smaller quantities, including
collection and delivery, being 45s. 2d. per ton.</p>

<p class="blockquot">In Belgium again, the station to station rate of 18s. 11d. per ton
(which should be 19s. 4d.) is for a minimum of 8 cwt., the rate,
including collection and delivery for the same minimum, being 24s.
3d. per ton.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The Dutch station to station rate of 14s. 10d. per ton (which should
be 15s. 7d.) is for full truck loads of not less than 5 tons, the
rate, including collection and delivery for any quantities, being
30s. 4d. per ton.</p>

<p>In the German tariff the rate is 2·15d. per ton per mile for
goods of every description in lots of less than 5 tons, with a
lower tariff divided into six classes for goods in full truckloads
of 5 and 10 tons. The latter have been compared with the
rates on English railways applicable to consignment of 500 lbs.
and over, or of 2 tons. The higher foreign tariff for such
traffic, in like circumstances, is not shown. To arrive at a
proper comparison, the English rate should, in many instances,
have been compared with the rates charged for &#8220;<i>Eilgut</i>&#8221; (or
fast goods service) on the continental lines. Of course, the
general public in Holland and Germany cannot avail themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
of the rates for 5 and 10 ton lots. They must deal with
carriers or forwarding agents, who perform many of the services
included in the rates on English railways, and who fill up, or
partially fill up, truckloads. The agents who pay the railway
transit charges are free to make their own charges to the
public without limitation. What would be instructive&mdash;what,
however, is not supplied&mdash;would be a comparison between what is
actually paid in England, and what the majority of the public
pay in Germany; it is of little interest to know <i>what the carriers
or forwarding agents pay</i> to the railway companies. The comparison,
such as it is, does not show the rate of conveyance per
ton, because the carriers have to pay as for five or ten
tons, even if that quantity is not in a wagon. They must make
charges to the public beyond the ordinary profits to cover
deficiencies in the loads per wagon, as well as for all the services
performed by them.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>In some instances, Sir B. Samuelson has not included in the
foreign rates the charge for loading and unloading. Bar-iron is a
case in point. In every other case he has omitted to include in
those rates the charges for weighing, counting, labelling, booking,
use of cranes, and advice of arrival of goods&mdash;all of which
are authorised additional charges beyond the tariff rates. In
this country, as is well known, such services are included in the
collected and delivered railway rates.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
Such are some examples of the errors vitiating the comparison.
We have by no means exhausted them; they might
be greatly multiplied. It is not intended to suggest that Sir B.
Samuelson has been more inaccurate than other critics. On the
contrary, his report, notwithstanding its inaccuracies, shows
that a considerable amount of labour has been expended in
endeavouring to obtain the information. It is a favourable
specimen of such criticisms, and for this reason it is deserving of
notice. It is, of course, difficult for any person, even when
practically acquainted with railway business, to appreciate the
practical effect of the different conditions under which traffic is
carried on Foreign and English railways. It is not surprising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
that Sir B. Samuelson has evidently not become fully acquainted
with all the conditions of carriage, or that he has omitted to give
them their proper value in the tables which he has prepared.
Unfortunately, owing to the omissions, the conclusions which he
draws are, in some cases, erroneous, and in others misleading.

<p class="space-above1">According to the test of railway receipts for conveyance
of minerals and goods, the killing process seems very slow indeed,
and it is not even sure, because in 1885 the railway receipts
for minerals were in some instances reduced. The average
receipts for minerals were about 2&frac14; per cent. less on the average
of the past two years as compared with those of the previous
three years. In the case of goods traffic this percentage was only
0·82 per cent. But, as against the above average receipts for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
1884 and 1885, let us place the average for the preceding nine
years. For minerals, £14,398,012; for goods, £19,635,080,
which shows an increased receipt on the average of the past
two years&mdash;on minerals of £989,431; on goods of £995,986.
Certainly these results are the reverse of decay in traffic or trade.</p>

<p class="space-below1">Another and better test is the tonnage of minerals

are insufficient to show the great depression in 1885. The fact is,
that in 1885 there was a larger tonnage of minerals conveyed
than in any year, with the exception of 1883, and a larger tonnage
of goods than in any year except 1882, 1883 and 1884.</p>

&nbsp;&#8221;&emsp;1885&nbsp; 7,415,000&nbsp; &#8221;</p>

<p>The fact is, that 1883 was an exceptional year. The tonnage
of minerals conveyed by railway in 1883 was 8,075,101 tons
greater than in 1882, 13,451,612 tons greater than in 1881,
and 23,815,308 tons greater than in 1880.</p>

conveyed in 1883 was 2,192,034 tons in excess of 1882, 5,886,356
tons in excess of 1881, and 7,262,031 tons in excess of the
tonnage of 1880.</p>

<p>The production of pig iron is not a real test, inasmuch
as large stocks accumulate at certain periods, and the ratio of
production is lessened in order to reduce the quantity in stock.</p>

<p>No doubt depression of trade may arise from lower prices.
The years 1876 and 1877 were probably those during which the
highest possible prices ruled for coal, iron, &amp;c. What were the
quantities conveyed by railway?</p>

<p class="space-above1">If lower prices now rule, it is clear there is a
very much larger volume of trade now than in the years of high prices.
That there has been depression in some branches of the trade of
the country may be a fact, but it is only natural to overrate and
overstate its reality and importance, and to cast blame upon the wrong parties.

<h2>APPENDIX III.<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">TARIFFS AND CONDITIONS FOR THE CONVEYANCE<br />OF MERCHANDISE TRAFFIC.</span></h2>

<h3>HOLLAND.</h3>

<p>There is no scale of rates universally chargeable in Holland;
each railway company is authorised by the Concession under
which the railway was constructed to charge certain specified
rates. The rates actually charged are, as in England, generally
lower than the maximum, and they are controlled by the State.</p>

<p>Although the same maximum rates do not govern all the
railways in Holland, and the classifications also vary, the basis
of a mileage scale is practically the same throughout, viz.:&mdash;a
rate per kilometre and per ton according to distance, and a fixed
charge for Station terminals according to class. The terminal
charges on Fast and &#8220;Piece&#8221; (ordinary) goods include loading
and unloading, but in the wagon load classes the terminals do
not include those services.</p>

<p>The tariff for the conveyance of through Goods Traffic&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
traffic exchanged between all Dutch Railways&mdash;is divided
into the following classes, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">1. Fast Goods, carried by ordinary Passenger Trains.</p>

<p class="blockquot">2. &#8220;Piece&#8221; (Ordinary) Goods, or consignments
under 5 tons carried by Goods Trains.</p>

<p class="blockquot">3. Truck loads&mdash;Classes A, B and C.</p>

The tariff of the <span class="smcap">Dutch Rhenish Railway</span>
is divided into the following classes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) Fast goods, which are usually forwarded by mixed Goods
and Passenger trains and by Fast Goods trains.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) General Goods in quantities of less than 5 tons not
mentioned in the classification as belonging to another class.
(Class I.)</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) General Goods in quantities of less than 5 tons which
pay less according to classification. (Class II.)</p>

<p>Goods of these two Classes in lots of at least 5 tons pay the
rate of Class A.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Bulk Goods which in quantities of at least 5 tons, or
quantities which are charged as if for that weight, are carried at
reduced rates. These are subdivided into Classes A, B, C and
D. Goods belonging to Class A, in quantities of 10 tons in one
truck are carried at the rates of Class B.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Special class&mdash;Goods which in consignments of 10 tons,
or paying for that weight, are carried at special reduced rates.</p></div>

<p>Goods in the Special Class must be in lots of 10,000
kilos. (10 Tons.) If a consignment weighed 11,000 kilos., the
first 10,000 kilos, would be charged at the Special Rate, and
the remaining 1,000 kilos. at the rate for Class I.</p>

<p>Goods in classes A, B, and C, are only charged at those rates
if the consignments exceed 5 tons.</p>

<p>Goods belonging to Classes B, C, and D, and to the Special
Class are carried in open wagons, the railway not being compelled
to provide covers; but the consignor may cover the
trucks <i>at his own expense and risk</i>, or give instructions in the
freight-note for having the goods rated according to Class A, in
which case they are treated in the same manner as goods belonging
to that class. An exception is made, however, in the case of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
those goods which, according to law, must be carried in open trucks.</p>

<p>The consignor may also give directions that the goods
belonging to Class A are to be carried at the rates of Class B,
in which case they are conveyed in open trucks. Those goods,
which although paying the rates of Class A, must be carried in
open trucks, are excluded from this regulation.</p>

<p>At the special request of senders, tarpaulins are supplied by
some of the railway companies, if there are any available, upon
payment of fl. 1.60 (2s. 8d.) each, for distances up to 225 kilometres,
with an additional charge of fl. 0.80 (1s. 4d.) for each
additional 225 kilom. The <span class="smcap">Dutch Rhenish</span> and
<span class="smcap">Holland Railway Companies</span> do not supply
tarpaulins under any circumstances.</p>

<p>The railway companies undertake no responsibility whatever for
damage arising from goods being carried in open trucks.</p>

<p>The following charges are allowed by law in addition to the
foregoing rates and terminals: and with few exceptions they are
the same on all railways.</p>

for insurance if the declared value of the goods, cattle, &amp;c., exceed that

pig, £1 5s. for a lean pig, 13s. 4d. for a sheep or goat, 7s. 8d. for
a dog, and £1 10s. per cwt. for other animals. If the value
exceeds these sums, and the consignor wishes to insure such
value being paid to him in case of damage, the premium is 1

of 4d.</p>

<p>The maximum value allowed for carriages and carts, including
the articles placed in them, is £42. If the value exceeds
that sum the premium payable is the same as for animals, with
a minimum of 3d.</p>

<p>The value allowed for goods is assumed by law not to exceed
£2 10s. per cwt. (30 fl. per 50 kilos). In case of whole or partial
loss, the commercial value of the goods&mdash;which has to be proved&mdash;is
taken as a basis. In the absence of data for arriving at the
commercial value, the value which similar goods would have at
the time and place of delivery is taken as the standard, deducting
the amount of duty and other costs not paid owing to loss.
If the goods are insured, the premium payable is one-tenth per
1,000 of the value declared, for each 93 miles (parts of that
distance reckoned as 93 miles), with a minimum of 2d.</p>

<p>In case of wilful misconduct on the part of the Company or

<p>In respect of goods for the first 94 miles, 1 per 1,000 of the

<p>If a single consignment of bulky goods occupies less than

<h3>BELGIUM.</h3>

<p>The basis on which the rates are fixed in Belgium is:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
(<i>a</i>) A fixed charge of one franc per ton, irrespective of
distance, which is practically equivalent to a structural
terminal charge for the use of stations and for clerkage.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>b</i>) A mileage scale, graduated according to distance.</p>

<p>On all lines worked by the State, whether constructed by
it, purchased by, or the subject of a concession, the local tariff
of the State Railways is applied generally. Before 1884, the
Grand Central Belge had a distinct classification and a tariff of
rates on the whole higher than that of the State Railways, but
the rates charged on the independent lines are now based on
those adopted by the State Railways, and sanctioned by the Minister.</p>

<p>The rates for traffic with France are framed by assimilating
the Belgian to the French scale, based on the shortest route;
for certain important kinds of traffic there are exceptional
tariffs, by which each Company make a reduction from their ordinary rates.</p>

<p>In addition to the weight and distance, the value, and bulk
of the goods are taken into consideration in the classification, if
it can be said that any classification exists.</p>

<p class="space-below1">The tariff of the State Railways contains a classification
which divides the <i>Petite Vitesse</i> goods into four classes. Besides
these, twenty special tariffs have been adopted.

<p class="f110">B&mdash;TARIFF FOR INTERCHANGED INLAND TRAFFIC.</p>

<p>The General Tariff comprises two Standard Scales, viz.:&mdash;Scale
<i>A</i> and Scale <i>C</i>.&mdash;Scale <i>A</i> is the same as the Local Tariff
except as regards the 4th Class rates for distances from 1 to 4
kilometres, for which a minimum of 5 kilometres per ton has
been fixed.</p>

<p>Scale <i>C</i> differs from Scale <i>A</i> only by an increase of&mdash;Franc
0.10 per 100 kilogrammes on the Tariff Rates Nos. 1 and 2,
and Franc 0.10 per 1000 kilogrammes on the rates of Tariff No.

for local export and import traffic Nos. 1 to 16, 20 and 22, with
the following two exceptions:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">
(<i>a</i>) The rates of the Special Tariffs in which the
Western of Flanders Railway Company is concerned are
uniformly increased by the addition of franc 0·10,
which is specially credited to them, except in the
case of Special Tariff, No. 7, the rates of which
are not increased.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
(<i>b</i>) Whenever the Special Tariffs involve the application
of the 4th Class rates, the rates fixed for the
5th kilometre have been adopted (the same way
as in the case of the General Standard Scales) for
distances of from 1 to 4 kilometres.</p>

<p class="f110">LIABILITY.</p>

<p>The Belgian Railway Administration undertake no responsibility
for a delay of six hours or less to horses and cattle, beyond
which their responsibility is limited to the amount of the carriage;
provided that the delay does not arise from any accidents,
accumulation of traffic, or circumstances beyond the Companies&#8217;
control. For Goods Traffic they are not responsible for</p>

<p class="blockquot no-indent">
Tariff &nbsp;No. 1. (Passenger Train), a delay of six hours or less.<br />
&emsp;&#8221;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;2. (Goods Train), a delay of one day or less.<br />
&emsp;&#8221;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;3. (Goods Train), a delay of two days or less.
</p>

<p>Their responsibility is limited to one-tenth of the carriage
for every day&#8217;s delay beyond the fixed time of transit. After the
expiration of 15 days the goods are considered lost. If they are
subsequently found Consignee is entitled to take delivery on
returning to the Railway three-fourths of the indemnity paid to
him. Senders may insure their goods against delay by payment of
a premium of 50 centimes per 1,000 frs. (5d. per £40), on the
value upon which they wish to be indemnified in case of delay.</p>

<p>In case of loss of, or damage to goods carried by passenger
train on the conditions of Tariffs Nos. 1 and 2, the Railways
are responsible to the extent of 4 frs. per kilogramme (1s. 6d.
per 1 lb.), and in respect of goods carried by goods train at the
conditions of Tariff No. 3, 75 centimes per kilogramme (3½d.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>
per 1 lb.) The goods can, however, be insured for their actual
value, the premium for insurance against damage or loss being 50
centimes per 1,000 frs., the same as for insurance against delay.</p>

<p>On payment of the two premiums the goods may be insured
at the same time against delay, damage or loss, but the indemnity
is in no case to exceed the actual loss sustained by the
owner through the delay, damage or loss.</p>

<p>The Railway Administration decline all liability for
damage:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot no-indent">
(<i>a</i>) Unless it be stated at the time of delivery,
or within 24 hours of advice of arrival of goods to
order, or if the goods are refused by consignee.</p>

<p class="blockquot no-indent">
(<i>b</i>) If the case or packing shows no outward trace
of breakage or wet.</p>

<p>They decline all liability for chafage, waste or leakage, or
for rust to iron, steel or zinc goods.</p>

<p>Live animals, perishables and provisions of all kinds,
chemical products, works of art (more especially pictures),
goods not packed or imperfectly packed, are only carried at
owner&#8217;s risk without any guarantee whatsoever on the part of the Railway.

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Prussian and German Law as to Rates.</span></p>

<p>By Article 33 of the Prussian Law relating to railway
undertakings, dated 3rd November, 1838, the Commissioners
were empowered, in certain events, to fix the maximum
tariff. If after deducting working expenses and a fixed
amount for the reserve fund, as sanctioned by the Ministers,
the net profits yielded more than 10 per cent. on the capital
expended, the railway rates were to be reduced so that the net
receipts should not exceed 10 per cent. If, on the other hand,
the receipts did not reach the maximum of 10 per cent. (Article
39), railway rates might be increased by 10 per cent. until the
receipts yielded 10 per cent. on the total capital. Subject to
these conditions, the fixing of the tariff rates was left to the
railway companies.</p>

<p>Article 45 of the Constitution of the German Empire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span>
 (dated 16th April, 1871) provides that the Government should secure,
as much as possible, the adoption of uniform and reduced tariffs,
especially for long distances for the carriage of coal, coke, wood,
ore, stones, salt, rough iron, manure, and similar goods, and that
such low rates should be adopted as might be required to further
the interests of the trade of the country. Article 46 enacts that
the railway companies in case of need, as for instance, the outbreak
of a famine, should carry provisions, such as grain, flour, and
potatoes, &amp;c., at such a reduced rate as circumstances might
require, and as directed by the Bundesrath Auschuss. Such special
rates are not, however, to be below the lowest rates charged by
the respective railways for &#8220;raw materials.&#8221;</p>

<p>By the terms of the early Concessions granted to railway companies
the greater part of the private railway companies in Prussia
had no power to fix or alter the tariff rates; reductions have
to be sanctioned by the Minister. For instance,&mdash;Clause 10
of the regulations of the Crefeld-Threis-Kempener Industrie
Railway Company (concession granted 6th October, 1868)
provides that&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;The State reserve a right to control the tariff
rates for goods, as well as passengers, and the alteration
of the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the same way Article 5 of the concession for the Dortmund
Granan Euscheder Railway Company of the 8th January,
1872, stipulates&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;That the Ministers of the Royal State reserve
their right to control the fares and rates for goods and
passenger traffic, as well as any subsequent modifications
in respect of the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clause 3 of the regulations of the Bergish-Märkische
Railway, which was transferred to the State on the 1st January,
1882 (concession dated 12th February, 1884), states that&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;The tariff for goods, as well as passengers, must
undergo no alteration without the sanction of the Royal
Ministers of Finance.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the more recent concessions the same rights have been
reserved to the State Ministers; but greater freedom is now
granted to the railway companies than was permitted during
the first years of working the lines. Maximum rate tariffs are
fixed by the Minister of Public Works for the various classes;
and, as in England, the companies may adopt rates, and modify
them as they please, as long as the maximum figures, fixed by
the State, have not been exceeded.</p>

<p>For the Prussian States railways the tariffs are now fixed
by the Royal Railway Administration, which is a species of a
Provincial Court; but before they can be put in force they must
be submitted for the approval of the Minister of Public Works.
The Railway Administration consist of a Chairman and eleven
Directors, and there are eleven Boards of Directors to manage
the Prussian States railways. For private railways the arrangements
are of a similar character. The application for rates and
conditions other than those published in the official tariffs is
prohibited by Prussian Law of the 3rd November, 1838, relative
to the working of railways. The granting of special conditions
to any particular sender or consignee is therefore legally inadmissible.
Any alterations in the tariff system must be submitted
to the Permanent Tariff Commissioners of the German
Railway Administration, appointed to study the interests of
trade. They consist of thirteen members of German railways,
four elected members for the protection of agriculture and trade,
and (in accordance with stipulations made by Bavaria) of, a
representative of the Bavarian trade interests. On the proposals
discussed at these Assemblies resolutions are passed by
the General Conference of German Railway Administration,
and the resolutions are submitted for the approval of the
Courts of Judicature.

<p>By the Regulation of Railways Act, 1844 (7 and 8 Vic.
cap. 85), the Government were given the right, on certain conditions,
to <i>revise</i> the scale of Tolls, Rates and Charges as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;Be it enacted, by the Queen&#8217;s most excellent Majesty, by
and with the advice and consent of the Lords, spiritual and temporal,
and Commons in this Parliament assembled, and by the authority of
the same, That if at any time after the end of twenty-one years
from and after the first day of January next, after the passing of
any Act of the present, or any future Session of Parliament for the
construction of any New Line of Passenger Railway, whether such
New Line be a Trunk, Branch, or Junction Line, and whether such
New Line be constructed by a New Company, incorporated for the
purpose, or by any existing Company, the clear annual profits
divisible upon the subscribed and paid-up Capital Stock of the said
Railway upon the average of the three then last preceding years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[Pg lxxi]</a></span>
shall equal or exceed the rate of <i>Ten Pounds</i> for every <i>Hundred
Pounds</i> of such paid-up Capital Stock, it shall be lawful for the
Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty&#8217;s Treasury, subject to the
provisions hereinafter contained, upon giving to the said Company
three calendar months&#8217; notice in writing of their intention to do so,
<i>to revise the scale of tolls, fares and charges</i>, limited by the Act or Acts
relating to the said Railway, and to <i>fix such new scale of tolls, fares
and charges</i>, applicable to such different classes and kinds of Passengers,
Goods, and other Traffic on such Railway as in the judgment of the
said Lords Commissioners, assuming the same quantities and kinds
of traffic to continue, shall be likely to reduce the said divisible
profits to the said rate of Ten Pounds in the Hundred: provided
always that no such revised scale shall take effect, unless accompanied
by a guarantee to subsist as long as any such revised scale of
tolls, fares, and charges shall be in force, that the said divisible
profits, in case of any deficiency therein shall be annually made good
to the said rate of Ten Pounds for every Hundred Pounds of such
Capital Stock, provided also that such revised scale shall not be again
revised or such guarantee withdrawn otherwise than with the consent
of the Company for the further period of twenty-one years.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the earlier Railway Acts were passed, Parliament
provided that the rates were to be charged equally throughout
the railway.</p>

<p>The following is a copy of one of the Clauses that were
inserted:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;Provided always, and be it further enacted, that the aforesaid
rates and tolls to be taken by virtue of this Act shall at all times be
charged equally, and after the same rate per ton per mile throughout
the whole of the said Railway in respect of the same description of
articles, matters or things, and that no reduction or advance in the
said rates and tolls shall, either directly or indirectly, be made partially
or in favour of or against any particular person or Company,
or be confined to any particular part of the said Railway, but that
every such reduction or advance of rates and tolls upon any particular
kind or description of articles, matters or things, <i>shall extend to and
take place throughout the whole and every part of the said Railway</i>,
upon, and in respect of the same description of articles, matters
and things so reduced or advanced, and shall extend to all persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[Pg lxxii]</a></span>
whomsoever using the same or carrying the same description of
articles, matters and things thereon, anything to the contrary thereof
in anywise notwithstanding.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the year 1845, however, Parliament by a Public Act cancelled the
prohibition against differential rates by the following Clause.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;And whereas it is expedient that the Company should be
enabled to vary the tolls upon the Railway, <i>so as to accommodate
them to the circumstances of the traffic</i>, but that such power of
varying should not be used for the purpose of prejudicing or favouring
particular parties, or for the purpose of collusively and unfairly
creating a monopoly, either in the hands of the Company or of particular
parties; it shall be lawful, therefore, for the Company, subject
to the provisions and limitations herein and in the special Act
contained, from time to time, to alter or vary the tolls by the special
Act authorised to be taken, <i>either upon the whole or upon any particular
portions of the Railway as they shall think fit</i>: provided
that all such tolls be at all times charged equally to all persons and
after the same rate, whether per ton, per mile or otherwise, in respect
of all passengers, and of all goods or carriages of the same description,
and conveyed or propelled by a like carriage or engine, passing
only over the same portion of the line of Railway under the same
circumstances; and no reduction or advance in any such tolls shall
be made either directly or indirectly in favour of or against any
particular Company or person travelling upon or using the
Railway.&#8221;</p>

<p>By Clause 15 of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1873, it was provided that:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;The Commissioners shall have power to hear and determine any
question or dispute which may arise with respect to the terminal
charges of any Railway Company, where such charges have not been
fixed by any Act of Parliament, and to decide what is a reasonable
sum to be paid to any Company for loading and unloading, covering,
collection, delivery and other services of a like nature; any decision
of the Commissioners under this section shall be binding on all Courts
and in all legal proceedings whatsoever.&#8221;

<p class="f150"><b>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</b></p>

<p>&#8220;There may be a difference of opinion as to some of the conclusions
expressed in Mr. Grierson&#8217;s interesting book; there can be but one
opinion as to its value and its opportuneness.... The vast foreign
literature relating to railways, of which too little is known in this country,
has been made use of. Obviously, the volume is by far the best statement
of one side of the railway problem; it is in every respect the clearest and
ablest exposition of the railway companies&#8217; case.... To members
of Parliament and others interested in this subject the volume will be
very valuable. It may not alter their present opinions; but henceforth
the subject must be discussed with somewhat new arguments and in the
light of new facts.... It is enough to say that the book will
probably be consulted by all persons claiming a right to speak on these
questions; that the critics of railway administration in England will be
ready to own that they have profited by it; and that the case of the railway
companies has never before been stated so clearly, consecutively, and
reasonably.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Times, December 14th, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;To an economic question which yields to few in its pressing
importance, a valuable contribution has been made in a work by Mr. Grierson,
General Manager of the Great Western Railway Company, entitled &#8216;Railway
Rates: English and Foreign.&#8217; (Edward Stanford.) ...
Whether in regard to argument or statistics the volume is one which no
railway reformer can afford to neglect.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Daily Telegraph,
December 10th, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly no better contribution could be readily made from the side
of the Railways, so clear is the writing of this little book, and so well
arranged are the facts.... On the whole, the book will no doubt
serve its purpose of hastening a reasonable settlement. The sooner the
public understand that the point of view of the directors is tenable, the
sooner will the inevitable compromise be sanctioned.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Daily News,
December 15th, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It would be an advantage if, before the question of railway rates
is again brought before Parliament, as it will be in the course of next
session, all who are to take part in its discussion would read with care the
case for the railway companies as it has been presented by Mr. Grierson in
the book now before us.... Mr. Grierson writes with such an abundant
knowledge of his subjects, and sets forth so clearly the difficulties
attending any attempt to regulate rates, that no one who reads it
intelligently can fail to rise from the study of his book with a better
understanding of the complex problem with which it deals, and better able
to assist in its solution.... Of Mr. Grierson&#8217;s book as a
whole, it may be said that, although it is not a vindication of the railway
companies, it shows that, in the main, they are serving the country well,
and abundantly proves that any active interference by outside authorities
in the details of their management is far more likely to prove harmful
than beneficial.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Economist, 18th December, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;As the best that can be said on behalf of the Companies, this volume
is invaluable: it is the ablest statement of the case which we have seen....
It is full of useful information, and by reason of its facts,
figures, and appendices, it is a volume which we cannot too highly
esteem.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Bullionist, 25th December, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Grierson&#8217;s book on &#8216;Railway Rates: English and
Foreign,&#8217; cannot be regarded as other than a valuable contribution to a most
important subject. The book bristles with facts and figures, that are of
unquestionable interest.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Scotsman, December 20th, 1886.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_a" id="Page_4_a">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>The much vexed question of terminals, mileage and uniform rates,
differential and other charges in connection with railway management are
discussed from a thoroughly practical point of view, and the facts and conclusions
brought forward cannot but have a most salutary effect in removing
unfounded prejudice, and creating a sounder public opinion with respect to
the railways of the United Kingdom.... The work now before
us will, at all events, leave the critics without excuse if they are not better
informed on the subject upon which they speak and write with such copious
fluency and limited knowledge.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Railway News, December 11th, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;In the mass of publications on the subject of railways, both at home
and abroad&mdash;the magnitude and character of which tend to bewilder rather
than enlighten&mdash;this book of Mr. Grierson&#8217;s, although conceived in a
spirit of defence simply, has developed into a powerful instrument in the cause of
justice&mdash;a careful compilation of facts, many of which have hitherto been
inaccessible, and an exponent of opinions which cannot fail to carry weight,
even though it may be said that they emanate from an interested source.
Such is the wide survey which the author makes of the situation, that
although he disclaims any idea of removing the many misconceptions in
circulation, or of affording an answer to all the charges which have been
made against railway companies, he has taken a step which will go far
towards accomplishing both these objects.... We may commend
the work with its appendix to the careful reading of all who are desirous of
arriving at a sound and equitable solution of the great railway problem,
which at this moment is a matter of importance and interest to all sections
of society.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Railway Times, December 18th, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The publication of a volume entitled &#8216;Railway Rates: English and
Foreign,&#8217; by Mr. J. Grierson, the General Manager of the Great Western
Railway, in which the case for the Railway Companies is fully and ably
stated, is a matter for genuine satisfaction.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Manchester
Guardian, December 21st, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;On all such points as terminal charges, high rates, and their effect on
trade, railway amalgamation, equal mileage rates, grouping here and on the
continent, Mr. Grierson&#8217;s volume will be found of much value, while it will
undoubtedly help to clear up certain misconceptions, and ought to prevent
the adoption of theories as to the fixing of rates, which could only be injurious
to trade, as well as contribute to an equitable and satisfactory
settlement of many railway questions now much discussed.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Liverpool
Mercury, December 25th, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. J. Grierson, General Manager of the Great Western Railway,
has just rendered a really excellent service to the mercantile community
and to those outside that category&mdash;if there be any such&mdash;who are
interested in the question of railway rates and charges and the numerous
cognate subjects which evolve out of that vastly important question....
To appreciate the work that the author has accomplished, the book
requires to be studied in its entirety, especially by all who aim at
thoroughly comprehending one of the most important subjects of the
day.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Glasgow Herald, December 17th, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Grierson&#8217;s book will be useful to all who desire to understand
what can be said in favour of the existing system,&#8221;&mdash;<i>Bristol
Evening News, December 10th, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Under this title Mr. Grierson publishes an exhaustive, able and
dispassionate <i>resumé</i> of all the conflicting statements, claims, and
interests verging round the much vexed question of Railway Rates.... We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5_a" id="Page_5_a">[Pg 5]</a></span>
have drawn freely on the materials which Mr Grierson has so seasonably
brought together, and we can only hope that the many who take an interest
in the question will thereby be tempted to seek the further information at
first hand.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Herapath&#8217;s Journal, December 11th, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt he will fail to satisfy all who believe that the present rates
require revision, but he must convince every reasonable person&mdash;everybody
who is not blinded by ignorant prejudice&mdash;that there is a great deal to be
said on behalf of the railway companies.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Figaro, December 25th, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;This is not an attempt to prove that all is for the best in the best
possible of railway systems; but simply to shew that some of the charges
brought against the companies are erroneous, others exaggerated, and many
of a contradictory character. We are further reminded that the question of
reform is extremely complicated, and warned against that &#8216;vague,
uninstructed notion&#8217; that &#8216;something must be done,&#8217; which has
been the bugbear of statesmen as well as directors. Hasty legislation should the
more be deprecated that there is &#8216;a fashion in so-called railway
reform&#8217;.... As to details, Mr. Grierson certainly brings out a
number of facts which make for caution in drawing conclusions. Thus the
figures quoted on pp. 144-48 seem to offer reasonable evidence that the
exportation of iron and coal is not prejudiced by the railway rates charged
in England as compared with those charged abroad.... Another
fact to be borne in mind: the average dividend on English railways
amounts to no more than 4·02 per cent., or two-fifths of the dividend which
in 1844 it was considered the railways should pay.&#8221;&mdash;<i>St. James&#8217;s
Gazette, January 1st, 1887.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;His figures have been procured from many sources at home and
abroad, and they are so handled as to afford very material support to the
case of the British Companies. As a defence of these companies Mr.
Grierson&#8217;s book is by far the best statement of that side of the question
which has appeared, consequently it is entitled to respectful and serious
consideration at the hands of those who are not counted amongst the thick-and-thin
partisans of such companies as at present managed. In saying
this, we do not desire to convey the impression that Mr. Grierson&#8217;s facts
and figures represent solely <i>ex parte</i> advocacy of the companies; on the
contrary, the book contains a large amount of information as to foreign
rates, which has not previously been succinctly presented to English
readers.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Ironmonger, December 26th, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;In his able and exhaustive work just issued Mr. Grierson has stated
the case for the companies completely, though concisely. He has, in fact,
produced a book which must take rank as an authority upon the subject,
and one with which it behoves everyone who pretends to an opinion upon
the matter to be well acquainted.... There are in this book
arguments which must be answered, and facts and figures that will have to
be faced by those who urgently call for measures of railway reform and
reduction of railway rates. The work, indeed, though full is fair, and its
publication should and will do much towards settling a long-vexed question
upon some reasonable terms of compromise.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Liverpool Guardian
Society&#8217;s Weekly Circular, December 31st, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The work which Mr. Grierson, the General Manager of the Great
Western Railway Company, has just published on railway rates is a particularly
able production, and its appearance now is very opportune....
Mr. Grierson&#8217;s contribution to the discussion of the question
abounds in facts and arguments, stated with a clearness and fairness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6_a" id="Page_6_a">[Pg 6]</a></span>
which do much to prepossess the reader in favour of the cause which is
so ably and reasonably represented. Many people will on reading this
book obtain for the first time something like a correct view of the
position really taken up by Railway Companies, and the arguments with
which they are prepared to support it. Many misconceptions will be
removed, and the most energetic opponent of the present policy of the
Companies will feel that there are, at any rate, two sides to many phases
of the controversy.... On the whole a strong case for the
Railway Companies is made out.&#8221;&mdash;<i>British Trade Journal,
1st January, 1887.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The most effective contribution to the controversy that has yet
been made from the Railway Managers&#8217; point of view, is a work on
&#8216;Railway Rates, English and Foreign,&#8217; by Mr. James Grierson, the
General Manager of the Great Western Railway, recently issued by Mr. Stanford.
Mr. Grierson, it is needless to say, is a skilled exponent of official views,
and he has fortified himself with an immense mass of information drawn
from Germany, France, Belgium and Holland, which he marshals in the
most effective manner possible, with a view to rebutting the arguments
of those who hold up the continental systems as models for England to
copy, or who contrast continental railway rates with British rates to
show under how much more favourable conditions continental manufacturers
work than their competitors in England. It may be frankly
confessed that Mr. Grierson shows that no close comparison can with
justice be made between the charges upon railway systems that have
been brought into existence, and are worked under conditions differing
widely in every respect from those that have prevailed in England....
Mr. Grierson&#8217;s comments and criticisms are weighty and practical,
and in the matter of differential rates and terminal charges, those
who dissent from his opinions will not find his arguments easy to
meet.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Liverpool Daily Post, 8th January, 1887.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;This is a very fine work by Mr. J. Grierson, General Manager of the
Great Western Railway. It is essentially a merchant&#8217;s and shipowner&#8217;s
book, and a copy of it should be in every counting house. If such works
were studied by merchants and merchants&#8217; clerks a little more, a good deal
of ignorance which prevails on the subject of British and Foreign Railway
rates would be cleared away.... We cannot too highly commend
this work to the mercantile community.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Hull Times,
8th January, 1887.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Now the public have the opportunity of hearing the Railway Companies&#8217;
counsel. Mr. Grierson&#8217;s position enables him to back his arguments
with a copious array of facts.... On the <i>audi alteram partem</i>
principle all the assailants of the present rates and working should make it
a point of duty to read what Mr. Grierson has to say, for those who undertake
to judge a righteous judgment it is absolutely essential to be acquainted
with his facts and references, and even for those who prejudge, it is convenient
to know what is the line of defence.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Birmingham Daily Post,
7th January, 1887.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Quite worthy of the position and traditions of the line he manages
is Mr. Grierson&#8217;s recent book on &#8216;Railway Rates, English and Foreign,&#8217;
which from its admirable arrangement, lucid language and courteous if
vigorous tone of controversy, deserves to become a commercial classic.&#8221;&mdash;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7_a" id="Page_7_a">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;To an economic question which yields to few in its pressing importance
a valuable contribution has just been made by Mr. Grierson, General
Manager of the Great Western Railway, entitled &#8216;Railway Rates, English
and Foreign.&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;<i>Wednesbury Herald, 18th December, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Grierson now comes forward in a new character, the literary
champion of British Railway Companies in reply to the severe criticisms on
our own Railway Rates, in comparison with those prevailing on the Continent....
He has said much and said it well; and indeed he
has shewn himself an able advocate for the great interest he represents.
The volume is a complete storehouse of facts and figures....
He has clearly defined the lines of the controversy, he has told with
admirable effect what the Companies have to say.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Weekly Bulletin,
25th December, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Grierson&#8217;s contribution to the controversy respecting Railway
Rates is of a valuable character, stating the case on behalf of the Companies
plainly and clearly, and adducing very strong arguments and a vast
array of facts and figures in support of the position they have taken up....
The subject of differential rates is treated most exhaustively....
The question of Terminal Charges is exhaustively discussed by Mr.
Grierson.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Bristol Mercury, 8th January, 1887.</i></p>

<p>Mr. J. Grierson has written a most interesting defence of the present
system of Railway Management.... It is seldom that so readable
a work is issued on a subject so apparently dry.... There
are many other interesting features in this work, and none more so than
the comparisons of the workings of English and Foreign Railways.&#8221;&mdash;
<i>Bristol Times and Mirror, 6th January, 1887.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;I should advise all who can to obtain this little work and read it.
It is quite a text book of railway management, and I must say that while
I sat down to read it with a strong prejudice against the railways, I
found it had gone long before I had finished it. It gives, in very fair
style, that &#8216;<i>other side</i>&#8217; which Englishmen always like to
hear.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;<i>H. F. M. Farmer&#8217;s Column</i>,&#8221;
<i>Bristol Times and Mirror, 15th January, 1887.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Grierson has done excellent service to the railway interest as
well as to the public, by the preparation of this very useful and complete
work.... The opinions expressed as to the principle upon which
railway rates should be based are indisputably sound.... For
more complete information and facts upon other matters of great importance
to the railway companies and the public generally, we commend to
our readers&mdash;notably to those who profess to be dissatisfied with the
present state of affairs&mdash;a careful study of this work. Some chapters on
the comparison of the working of English and Continental railways are
specially deserving of attention, and the facts given are well calculated to
remove much misapprehension which appears to exist on the subject.&#8221;&mdash;
<i>Railway Record, 15th December, 1886.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. James Grierson has laid the railway world under a deep obligation
by the publication of &#8216;Railway Rates, English and Foreign.&#8217; ...
The facts and arguments, presented in clear, firm, incisive language, cannot
fail to impress, instruct, and interest whoever this vast question in any
way affects.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Railway Official Gazette, January, 1887.</i></p>

Before Mr. Cardwell&#8217;s Committee (23rd February, 1853) the late
Mr. Robert Stephenson, the eminent engineer, gave the following illustration,
which is not yet antiquated:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;I referred to that in order to shew the Committee the great
impropriety of attempting anything like an equal mileage rate on
railways. I can elucidate that in a very remarkable manner, and shew
the injustice that the carrying out of the principle would inflict upon
some railway companies, especially where goods are concerned. I
will take the case of the Great North of England Railway, from
Newcastle coal-field towards York, and towards the rivers Tees and
Tyne. In one direction there were 5,450,000 tons of coals carried
over one mile, which was equal to 320,588 over one mile for each
engine; there having been employed by the York, Newcastle and
Berwick Company for the performance of that duty 17 engines.
Towards York, where the distance was greater, and the gradients
were better, and the loads heavier, and the work more uniform, 13
engines took 14,435,000 tons over one mile, which was equal to
1,110,000 tons for each engine over a mile; in the other case, the
duty that one engine performed was carrying 320,588 tons over a mile;
therefore in this case one engine has done 3·466 more work than the
other engine, so that on the first line it cost the Company nearly four
times as much as it cost them for doing the same duty on the other
line. On the one line there are a number of collieries; the engines
have to stop and pick up the traffic, and the railway wagons do not
average perhaps more than seven or eight miles per day, whereas in
the other case they work for hours continuously, and with heavier
loads and no stoppages.&#8221;</p></div>

About thirty years ago, when the iron works at Westbury in Wiltshire
were constructed, it was anticipated that fuel would be obtained from
the Badstock district, about 14 miles distant. But after sinking collieries
it was found that the coke was not suitable; so that it has now to be
obtained from South Wales, a distance of about 130 miles. The pig iron is sent
to South Wales in the return coke wagons, and also to South Staffordshire,
a distance of 140 miles. The coke and pig iron are carried at special
low rates below those in force for traffic to intermediate places. Without
such special rates, or if mileage rates were charged, the works would have
to be closed.</p></div>

An American writer points out that the following would be the result
of applying the principle of equal mileage rates, or of basing rates on cost
of service:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. &#8220;There would be little or no classification of freights.
Grain, lumber, coal, iron, shoes, dry goods, groceries, drugs and
chemicals, would all have to pay near about the same rate per
100 pounds per mile, and that rate would have to be something
like an average of the present rates charged upon the different
classes of freight. The higher classes of freight would be a
good deal lowered, and the lower classes would be materially
raised. The result would be that cheap and heavy products
could be no longer transported over the distances that are now
carried.</p>

<p>2. &#8220;The rates on through freight would have to be proportioned very
nearly to the distance hauled. The rate from Chicago to Boston
for instance, would be materially higher, and the rate from
Chicago to Baltimore materially lower than the rates from
Chicago to New York.</p>

<p>3. &#8220;Roads having the lowest grades, and most favourable alignment
would have lower rates than their competitors, and would
monopolise the business, to the entire exclusion of those lines
which traverse more difficult and expensive territory, and upon
which the cost of transportation was greater. And the tide
once turned, the evil would multiply itself; for the rates would
decrease rapidly on the favoured roads, with the increase of
business, and would increase on the unfortunately located roads,
with the decrease in volume of their freight, until the latter
would be left with nothing but their local business to support
them, which would then have to be advanced to the highest
figures possible.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Railroad Transportation, by E. P. Alexander,</i>
<i>Vice-President of the Louisville and Nashville Railway Company.</i></p></div>

Very recently the fishermen in the North of Scotland have been
asking that the same gross rates shall be charged from Wick to large towns

to equal mileage rates?</p></div>

&#8220;We have nothing to do here with the study of the tariff systems
adopted on the Alsace-Lorraine lines, and extended with some modifications
to the generality of German lines. Seductive by its simplicity,
the principle of fixing the rate according to the weight only, and without
regard to the value of the object carried, has not found numerous partisans
in France. Such a radical reform would overthrow our commercial habits,
and would occasion results, in a financial point of view, which would be
impossible for us to estimate.&#8221; Report of the French Commission of the

In the evidence given before the Select Committee in 1881, the
rates for foreign hops from Boulogne to London were compared with the
rates charged for home grown hops from the Ashford and Canterbury districts
to London. The former were complained of as being an undue
preference in favour of foreign produce. No doubt there was a considerable
difference. The rate from Boulogne to London was 17s. 6d., and that from
Ashford to London, 38s. It was, however, shewn that the rate of 17s. 6d. per
ton for foreign hops from Boulogne to London was a station to station
rate, while the rate of 38s. per ton from Ashford to London included
delivery and all station services, and that owing to the difference in the
mode of packing the hops, 73 per cent. more foreign hops than English
hops could be loaded in a truck. The railway companies concerned urged
that the home producer was not prejudiced by the transit rate complained
of. While it enabled the railway companies to obtain the conveyance of
a portion of the foreign hops, an increase of the rate from Boulogne
would not be of any benefit to the English grower. The foreign hops
would still find their way to London direct by sea. The rate of 17s. 6d.
per ton from Boulogne to London was cancelled in deference to the complaints.
What is the result? The foreign hops are imported as before;
but they are now carried by the General Steam Navigation Company.
The railway companies have to some extent suffered; the English producer
has gained nothing.</p></div>

Lines of steamers carrying Belgian, Dutch, German, and French

Havre and London. In competition with them the Great Eastern,
South Eastern, and London Chatham and Dover Companies carry <i>viâ</i>
Harwich, Folkestone and Dover respectively, at such rates as they can
obtain in competition with those charged by steamer direct. It has been a
subject of complaint that these goods are conveyed at lower rates than
similar merchandise from places in Essex or Kent, past which they are
carried by rail. No doubt the regular and quick services provided by the
railway companies are of great advantage to the senders and consumers.
But so far as London is concerned, a great part, if not the whole of the
goods, not requiring quick transit could be sent by sea direct, if the
Harwich, Dover, and other services were discontinued.</p>

<p>There are import rates to towns in the interior to which there is no
direct sea competition. If such rates are not based on the rates to places to
which there is such competition, <i>plus</i> the local rates, they may be
open to question to an extent not applicable to the rates to and from ports.</p></div>

Many of the rates from Hull are affected by inland water
competition, or by those charged from Liverpool. On the other hand,
the rates from Hull govern those from Grimsby (as a competing port),
Harwich, West Hartlepool, Newcastle, Sunderland and Shields. In fact,
a large portion of the anomalies in railway rates arise from the
competition between ports. Although improvements in detail as to such
rates, no doubt, are possible, the interests of some ports would be
seriously affected by any change in the principle on which railway
rates are fixed.</p></div>

The following are some of the opinions of French

<p>In a report to the French Chamber of Deputies by a Railway Commission
in 1880, the Commissioners approved of special tariffs, and added:
&#8220;We are even inclined to suggest the development of traffic of this
nature, the importance of which is not at all in proportion to
the natural advantages which France derives from her geographical
position and her numerous ports.&#8221; <i>Appendix 31 to Report from the

Until recently, the classification of imported and
exported goods, in force on the Northern of France Railway, was
composed of six classes. A new tariff is now in force, the rates for
such traffic varying from frs. 8 to frs. 30 per 1000 kilogrammes.</p>

<p>For the purpose of comparison, the rates charged for imported and
exported goods are shewn under the respective classes in which the
same articles are generally included when charged at the ordinary
class rates.</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Note</span>&mdash;The <i>Montreal Gazette</i>, 1st April, 1886,
writes thus on the subject of the Railway Commission Bill:&mdash;&#8220;These
rates are fixed and determined by the Great American Trunk Lines,
in competition with which the Tariff of the Canadian roads is
necessarily regulated; to interfere with these rates would be
to take away from the Canadian Companies a large amount of the
gross earnings derived from a source which increases the volume
of business in Canada.... The discrimination which is complained
of in particular localities arises wholly out of an established
competition between lines reaching a favoured point. Destroy the
natural consequences and natural advantages of competition&mdash;lower
rates&mdash;and you remove all inducement to the provision of rival
routes; put an end to competition, and at once an increase in
rates all round will be established. The Railway Act prohibits
interference by the Government in the regulation of rates until a
Company is proved to earn 15 per cent. upon its invested capital.
What Railway Company in the Dominion to-day is earning that
profit?... If competition is to be made a positive disadvantage,
if every inducement to particular localities to promote rival
enterprises is to be swept away, the rates of existing lines will be
run up in all directions to the injury not only of every locality
now favoured by competition, but of those localities which consider
themselves aggrieved by reason of the absence of the low rates which
competition enforces.&#8221;</p>

<p>It may be mentioned that one of the fiercest enemies of differential
rates, in a work recently published, declares that the only remedy
is to &#8220;restore the character of public highways to the railways by
securing to all persons the right to run trains over their tracks
under proper regulation!&#8221; &#8220;The Railways and the Republic&#8221; (1886),

<span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The evidence of Sir Thomas Farrer, given
in 1881, is very deserving of consideration. In answer to the
question, &#8220;Now turning to the question of inequality of charges, of
which the Committee have had many complaints&mdash;in fact, the bulk of
the complaints have been with regard to the inequality of charges
from one place to another&mdash;in your opinion, is this inequality
productive of injury to the trade of the country?&#8221; He replies, &#8220;As
far as I can judge, it is not.&#8221; He is asked:&mdash;&#8220;I suppose you would
say that while on the one hand one portion of the country may be a
loser, another portion of the country is a gainer, and that the one
may be set against the other?&#8221;&mdash;He answers:&mdash;&#8220;I am not quite
certain that I should say that one portion of the country is a loser, but I
am quite certain that another portion is a gainer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again, in reply to question: &#8220;Then looking at the question also from
the point of view of the public, the inland towns which are charged
higher than towns on the sea-coast are merely paying the natural
penalty of being inland towns, and not having an equally good
geographical position?&#8221;&mdash;He states, &#8220;Quite so; on the whole
I should think the inland towns were proportionately better off than before
the railways existed, because, before the railways existed, sea-side
towns had the water traffic to themselves, but now the railways
afford a kind of competition with that traffic, and bring a great
many places into communication with one another which could not have
been brought into communication before.&#8221;</p>

<p>In reply to the question, &#8220;On the whole, do you think the country
gains by these rival routes to the outports?&#8221; He says, &#8220;I do
distinctly.&#8221; And again, in answer to the question, &#8220;According
to your view, then, as far as the public is concerned, it is of no
consequence that a railway company should so destroy the natural
advantages of one place?&#8221; He replies:&mdash;&#8220;I think it is one
purpose of the railway companies to annihilate distance as far as they
can; I would certainly encourage the railway companies in bringing
Shetland fish to the London market, even although the effect of it
were to lower the price of the Grimsby fish.&#8221; Further, in reply to
the question, &#8220;As far as that is concerned, you would allow the
Railway Companies to make any differential charges they may please
for or against other localities?&#8221; He replies:&mdash;&#8220;I would
certainly not compel them to charge upon fish from Thurso and fish from
Grimsby in proportion to the distances of those two places. I have
been accustomed, as a free trader, to consider the interest of
the consumer very largely; but it seems to me that this claim for
regular mileage has proceeded upon the interest of one special class
of producers; but it is very much to the interest of the consumer
as well as to one class of producers, that the people at a distance
should be able to send to the consuming market.&#8221;</p></div>

In the Report made by M. Richard Waddington in the
name of the Commission of the Third System of Railway Tariffs,
special or differential rates are thus referred to. &#8220;These Tariffs
are established in compliance with a trade demand which varies, as
one can easily understand, according to the locality and district
concerned. Like intelligent merchants the administrators of the
railway companies have based their rate of charges on the law of
<i>Supply and Demand</i>....&#8221; The celebrated expression of M. Solacroup,
director of the <i>Orleans Company</i>, sums up the considerations which
led to the compilation of special tariffs. &#8220;<i>In the matter of
Transport Tariffs there is only one rational rule, viz., to ask of
merchandise all it can pay; any other principle is no principle.</i>&#8221;</p></div>

It may be objected that under such a system companies
might extort exorbitant sums from traders who must send their goods.
But (1) the figures and returns referred to later on show that in
fact the companies have not made such charges, but have benefited
every industry as well as themselves; (2) the statutory maxima
cannot be exceeded; (3) at many points there is effective sea and
canal competition; (4) the result of increasing the rates to a
height which prevents the producer from earning a fair profit must,
in the long run, be to diminish the traffic of the railway; (5)
there is always a liability when, high rates exist that Parliament
will sanction a new line, even if the chances of its financial
success be not great.</p></div>

See Ricardo (Principles of Political Economy and
Taxation, 3rd Section, page 144): &#8220;Of all commodities none are
perhaps so proper for taxation as those which, either by the aid
of nature or art, are produced with peculiar facility. Taxes on
luxuries have some advantage over taxes on necessaries, they are
generally paid from income, and therefore do not diminish the

&#8220;A tax upon carriages in proportion to their weight,
though a very equal tax when applied to the sole purpose of
repairing the roads is a very unequal one when applied to any other
purpose, or to supply the common exigencies of the State. When it
is applied to the sole purpose above mentioned, each carriage is
supposed to pay exactly for the wear and tear which that carriage
occasions of the roads. But when it is applied to any other purpose,
each carriage is supposed to pay for more than that wear and tear
and contributes to the supply of some other exigency of the State.
But as the turnpike toll raises the price of goods in proportion
to their weight, and not to their value, it is chiefly paid by the
consumers of coarse and bulky, not by those of precious and light,
commodities. Whatever exigency of the State, therefore, this tax
might be intended to supply, that exigency would be chiefly supplied
at the expense of the poor, not of the rich; at the expense of
those who are least able to supply it, not of those who are most
able.&#8221;&mdash;(<i>Wealth of Nations.</i> Book 5 part 3.)</p></div>

In the same year a Statute (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 28) was
passed giving canal companies powers to vary tolls in the same

passed the same session, canal companies were authorised to become
carriers on their canals and &#8220;to make such reasonable charges for
conveying, warehousing, collection and delivery as they might
respectively from time to time determine upon, in addition to the
several tolls or dues which any such company or undertakers were

Committee on Railways (Rates and Fares), of 1881-2. Whilst stating
&#8220;Your Committee cannot recommend any new legislative interference
for the purpose of enforcing upon Railway Companies equality of
charge.&#8221; They add: &#8220;Some of the inequalities of charges complained
of are to the advantage rather than to the disadvantage of the
public, where there is an <i>undue preference</i> the law now gives a
remedy.&#8221; They also give the following illustration:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;That Greenock sugar refiners should be in the same markets as the
sugar refiners of London, while it may be a grievance to London
refiners, must be an advantage to Greenock refiners, and cannot be a
disadvantage to buyers of sugar.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is added that the effect of interference with the freedom to fix
rates according to special circumstances would in this instance be
&#8220;to give a practical monopoly to the London sugar refiners who would
be the real gainers by the transaction. It does not appear to your

&#8220;The fact of the railways being in the hands of Government is by
no means an unmixed good. A uniform system of rates is demanded
everywhere. If a concession is made to one district, the rest of
the colony naturally demand to be placed on the same footing, so
that the Railway Department rarely meet the wishes of the public.
<i>A private Company, if it found that the freight could be got by
lowering the tariff on some particular item, would do so at once,
and if it paid, continue it.</i> The cost probably would be merely
a few tons of coals, and a small amount for wear and tear. <i>Many
trades, notably the timber trade, are very much hampered by the
Government tariff which does not admit of differential rates.</i>&#8221;</p>

The Report of the French railway Commission of Inquiry
appointed in 1880 states: &#8220;Our railway companies have been largely
subventioned for the construction of their lines, almost all receive
annual subsidies, without which they could not meet the charges of
their working expenses; all enjoy a monopoly which shelters them
from internal competition; we have the right to demand from them, to
force upon them, reforms that public and parliamentary opinion deem
indispensable.&#8221; And again&mdash;&#8220;* * * * In certain countries, England
for example, where the system of liberty and commercial competition
is largely in vogue, it is right that the railway companies, who
have received nothing and from whom nothing is demanded by the
State, and who may be considered only as belonging to the category
of private merchants and manufacturers, should have greater freedom
in dealing with their traffic and tariffs than is enjoyed in this

acquiring the railways and guaranteeing the dividends for such a
reason; the number of lines of railway and routes are so ample, and
the number of engines, carriages, and wagons so great, that any
movement required for the defence of the country can be carried
out within any reasonable time, while under the Regulation of the
Forces Act, 1871, Her Majesty, by Order in Council, may empower
any person or persons, named in such warrant, to take possession
of any railroad and of the plant belonging thereto, and to use the
same for Her Majesty&#8217;s Service at such times and in such manner as
the Secretary of State may direct; and the directors, officers, and
servants of any such railroad, shall obey the directions of the
Secretary of State.</p></div>

In the Report of May 3, 1882, made by Sir H. Barron to
the then Minister for Foreign Affairs (Earl Granville) (part 4 of
the &#8220;Reports by Her Majesty&#8217;s Secretaries of Embassy and Legation on
Manufactures, Commerce, &amp;c.,&#8221;) on the subject of the Belgian Budget,
the former stated that &#8220;The 5 years from 1876 each closed with a
deficit rising in 1881 to 6&frac14; million francs (£250,000), the main
explanation being the ever-increasing burden thrown on the Treasury
by the extension of the railway, which undertaking has ceased to
cover its charges and completely disturbed the financial equilibrium
of the State. The first lines constructed and worked by the State,
being great trunk lines, gave every year an increasing return
which enriched the Treasury. To these were first added conceded
lines, which had to be purchased from companies at high prices;
then secondary lines, whose traffic was unremunerative. After many
previous experiments, the accounts of the railway have been since
1878 drawn up on a new and presumedly more accurate principle. The
Treasury is now considered as the bankers of the railway; it is
assumed that all funds advanced by the former are chargeable with
an interest of 4 per cent., and repayable within ninety years.
According to this new method of book-keeping, it appears that the
railway contributed largely to the revenue until 1872 inclusively,
but that since that year it has, on the contrary, entailed an annual
loss. Thus, the deficit of 1881 is for the greater part (4,861,725
fr.) due to the insufficiency of the railway revenue. Fortunately
Belgium has a resource at hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Minister of Finance in the debate on the Budget of Public
Works, points to that resource in the following pregnant words:
It is proved that the railway fails to cover its charges by
about five millions (£200,000). We are informed that this year
the deficiency may be seven millions; in 1883, possibly even ten
millions. What will it be in 1884? No one knows, but the progression
is ascending. Must we follow it without counting the cost? Must we
raise the tariffs or throw on the Treasury the burden caused by the
insufficiency of the railway receipts? <i>Either the railway must be
worked on a principle which shall allow it to cover its charges or
the taxpayers must make up the difference.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>He further added that in his report of 1876 he recommended &#8220;<i>a
raising of the tariff</i>.&#8221; Sir H. Barron goes on to state &#8220;<i>that
the inferior productiveness of the Belgian Railway was due to the
inadequate tariff, which, for passengers and merchandise, was much
lower than those prevailing in the rest of Europe</i>.&#8221; He further
remarks, however, that &#8220;notwithstanding all this <i>it has been
held</i> that the experiment is a great success, and bears evidence
in favour of State ownership, because, as the railway is worked in
the interest of trade, &amp;c., it is considered that the benefit thus
indirectly accruing to the public at large, is greater than that
which might be realised by aiming at a commercial profit for the
direct and immediate benefit of the taxpayers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The construction of railways in Belgium has, no doubt, developed
the commerce and industry of the country to a remarkable extent.
It was stated by Sir Bernhard Samuelson (page 9 of Report) that
the receipts of railways had increased from £1,815,000 in 1870 to
£4,880,000 in 1883, or 168 per cent.; but he omitted to point out
that the length of the railways had increased by more than 250 per cent.</p>

<p>See the observation of M. Leon Say as to the tendency to reduce
railway tariffs to an unremunerative point when the State is the
owner.&mdash;<i>Le Rachat des Chemins de Fer, Journal des Economistes,
1881, p. 343.</i></p></div>

See page 5 of Sir B. Samuelson&#8217;s report. It is not
known to what the observation as to charges to capital can refer.
The larger (if not all) companies in this country charge to revenue
portions of the cost of improvements to stations, sidings, &amp;c.,
which might strictly be charged to capital. In the published returns
of the working of German railways, there is nothing to show to what
extent, if any, the cost of new works is charged to capital.</p></div>

The number of passengers, or tons of goods are not
reliable for the purpose of comparison, inasmuch as a passenger or

The inflated prices charged in 1873-4 led to the
establishment of new collieries in Glamorganshire and Monmouthshire,
which raise about 6,000,000 tons per annum; this, with the increased
output of the then existing collieries, is equal to an increase of
about 50 per cent. of the previous tonnage raised in these counties
which, with about 30 per cent. increase in other parts of the
country, has prevented colliery proprietors obtaining a reasonable
profit since 1875, and probably will do so until the demand
overtakes the supply.</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The following remarks, contained in the
report of the Joint Committee of 1872, on the subject of periodical
revision of rates, are worth reading&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;The difficulty has been felt by many of the witnesses, and they have
accordingly suggested that there should be a periodical revision of
rates and fares.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;Here, again, we are met in the first instance by the same
difficulty as before. The companies will, if experience is any
guide, constantly, for their own sakes, charge less than their legal
maxima. Is this revision to take effect on their legal maxima, or
on the actual rates as they voluntarily reduce them? If the former,
its results will be small; if the latter, it will be difficult to
effect, and may bear hardly upon the companies in stereotyping a
temporary or experimental reduction. In fact, the proposals for
revision of rates, if they are to be effectual, really presuppose
some such determination of rates according to a fixed standard as
we have considered above. If there are no special rates, it is a
comparatively simple thing to make a general reduction. If there
are special rates it becomes a very difficult task. But a still
more serious question with respect to periodical revision is the
question&mdash;On what principle is it to be performed, and by whom? If it
is to be purely arbitrary, if no rule is to be laid down to guide the
revisers, the power of revision will amount to a power to confiscate
the property of the companies. It is not likely that Parliament would
attempt to exercise any such power itself, still less that it would
confer such a power on any subordinate authority. Accordingly the
witnesses have suggested that the revision should take effect under
conditions which would reserve to the companies a reasonable amount
of profit, and to some revision founded on this principle, it appears
from the evidence that some, at least, of the principal railway
companies would not object.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;This leads to the further consideration of the important question,
whether it is possible or desirable to fix by law a maximum of
profit, or dividend. If it is not possible or desirable to do so,
any periodical or systematic revision of charges by any authority
subordinate to Parliament, may be pronounced impracticable.&#8221;

The rates for &#8220;interstate&#8221; traffic in the United States
are not at present subject to any Government control, but are made
at the discretion of the companies to meet the requirements of
trade, competition by rail and water, and of cities. Two Bills for
the regulation of the interstate traffic of railways have recently
been before Congress; one, the &#8220;Reagan&#8221; Bill, which proposes to fix
the charges, to prohibit any discrimination, and to make it illegal
for railway companies &#8220;to combine or to pool&#8221; their receipts without
stringent provisions and penalties. The other Bill, entitled the
&#8220;Cullom&#8221; Bill, proposed the appointment of an Interstate Commission
consisting of five members, but did not provide for any specific or
maximum rates for the transportation of passengers or merchandise,
except that they should be reasonable and that there should be no
unfair discrimination; while laying down the principle that the
rates should be in proportion to the distance carried, it proposed
to give to the Commissioners power, in their discretion, to allow
lower rates to be charged for long, as compared with short distance
traffic. The former Bill passed the House of Representatives and was
rejected by the Senate; the &#8220;Cullom&#8221; Bill passed the Senate, and was
rejected by the House of Representatives.</p></div>

Report of the Committee of Commerce, House of
Representatives of the United States, March 8th, 1886.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Committee on Commerce, to whom was referred the bills (H. R.
309) to establish a Board of Commissioners of interstate commerce,
and for other purposes; (H. R. 770) to regulate interstate commerce
through a national court of arbitration (H. R. 1,572) to create
an interstate commerce commission, and to regulate its powers and
duties; (H. R. 1,669) to establish a bureau of transportation
in the Department of the Interior; (H. R. 2,412) to regulate
interstate commerce and to prevent unjust discriminations by common
carriers; and (H. R. 3,929) to establish a Board of Commissioners
of interstate commerce, and to regulate such commerce, beg leave to
report said bills back to the House, and ask that they be laid on
the table, and to report the accompanying bill as a substitute for
H. R. 2,412, and recommend its passage.</p>

<p>&#8220;The subject matter of these bills has been so fully and elaborately
discussed for several years past, that it is not deemed necessary in
this report to enter into an elaborate explanation of the provisions
of the bill reported to the House. Your committee may
state, however, that the several bills referred to them rest upon
three different theories.</p>

<p>&#8220;House bills 309, 1,572, 1,669 and 3,929 are framed upon the idea
of providing a governmental commission, and of making detailed
regulations of freight rates. The theory of these bills did not need
the approval of the committee.</p>

<p>&#8220;House bill 770, &#8216;To Regulate Interstate Commerce through a National
Court of &#8216;Arbitration,&#8217; looks to the establishment of a court with
power extending in some measure to the regulation of commerce
between States, with provisions extending to the regulation of
subjects not believed to be within the jurisdiction of Congress, and
not embracing in its provisions matters of regulation believed to be
necessary in a bill of this kind; and a single court to be held at
Washington City, as provided in this bill, would not be sufficiently
convenient to the people.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bill which we report to the House, and which is an amendment
of House bill 2,412, is based upon the theory of furnishing civil
remedies in the courts of ordinary jurisdiction to parties for the
most conspicuous grievances complained of in railroad management,
prohibiting what should not be done, and commanding what should
be done; proposing remedies for the violation of its provisions,
and avoiding any attempt at detailed regulation of freight rates.
This was deemed best as the first effort at legislation upon this
subject. The interests involved are so large, and their successful
management so important to the country, that it was not deemed
advisable to run any risk of embarrassing the management of the
railroads of the country, and at the same time it was deemed
necessary for the protection of the interests of the people to
control and circumscribe the exercise of the monopoly powers of
these corporations, to prevent them from making extortionate charges
and unlawful exactions upon the people.</p>

<p>&#8220;The examination of this subject will show that the attempt to
establish a system of legislative rates is impracticable, for the
reason that what would be a reasonable rate for one road would be
ruinous, perhaps, to others, as the charges for the transportation
of freights are largely controlled by the amount of business done by
the several roads.</p>

<p>&#8220;For instance, what would be a reasonable rate of charges on the
Pennsylvania Railroad would not be a reasonable rate upon a road in
the new States and in a sparsely settled portion of the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;The same difficulty lies in the way of attempting to protect the
people by the adoption of maximum rates. What would be a reasonable
maximum upon one road would not be reasonable upon others. A maximum
high enough to protect the railroads against harm would be too
high to benefit the people on most of the roads, and a maximum low
enough to protect the people on some roads would be ruinous to the
interests of many other roads, so that it is not believed best to
attempt to protect the interests of the public by the legislative
rates or by the maximum rates.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bill which we report to the House, instead of adopting either
of these plans, provides that the charges of the railroads shall be
reasonable; that persons engaged in the transportation of interstate
commerce by railroads shall furnish without discrimination the
same facilities for the carriage, receiving, delivery, storage
and handling of property of a like character, and shall perform
with equal expedition the same kind of services connected with
contemporaneous transportation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;These constitute a portion of the leading features of the bill
which we report to the House. It is believed that the enactment and
enforcement of such a law will provide for the just and necessary
abridgment of the monopoly powers of these corporations, and
protect the people against unreasonable charges and extortionate
exactions, and will at the same time not interfere with or embarrass
the management of railroad corporations in anything which it is
reasonable and just they should do. And the Committee believe it
wiser and better to provide for the enforcement of the provisions
of such a law through the instrumentality of the ordinary courts
of justice, and by the judges and juries of the country than by
the orders of a commission. The machinery of the courts is already
in existence, and will require no additional expense, and is
within convenient reach of the people everywhere, and is fully
able to adjudicate all cases which may arise under this bill and
by methods with which the people are familiar, while no
plan of a commission which has been proposed could be conveniently
accessible to all the people, and if a plan should be presented
which would provide a jurisdiction convenient to all the people it
would necessarily be cumbrous and very expensive. In this view a
commission is unnecessary, unless it is the purpose of Congress to
enter upon the detailed regulation of freight rates.&#8221;

The railways in this country are governed by directors
who have shares in the respective undertakings, and represent the
shareholders (assumed to be about 500,000), but generally their
interest in the railways is relatively small compared with that
which they possess in land, manufactories, collieries, ironworks,
and commerce &amp;c., besides which from their local connections,
and as public men, they are keenly alive to the requirements of
agriculture, trade and commerce, and in reality represent those
interests to a much greater extent than is sometimes assumed to be
the case.</p></div>

In a case of the kind referred to, which was brought
before the Board of Trade when the Bill was before Parliament, as a
skilled officer of the company was occupied 150 hours, in preparing
the information alone to reply to the Board of Trade, irrespective
of the time occupied by others in analysing the information, and in
corresponding with the Board of Trade on the subject, all of which
had no practical result.</p></div>

In Lees <i>v.</i> Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire, 1 N. &amp; M. 352,
the Commissioners relied to some extent upon a principle which
they do not appear to have since put in force. The question was
whether the company gave an undue and unreasonable preference to the
Corporation. The Commissioners said that undoubtedly a preference
had been given, but they declined to say it was unreasonable (1)
because the Corporation did not compete with the complainants; (2)
because <i>the preference was for the public benefit and convenience</i>
(p. 367); (3) because of the nature and magnitude of the coal
traffic of the Corporation.</p></div>

terminal traffic, there might be competition with another railway.&#8221;</p></div>

The reporters append the following note to the case.</p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;It appears that competition between two railways, or by sea or
canal, is sufficient justification for a railway company reducing
its fares to the public, who are affected by such competitions, and
can take advantage; but that a railway company cannot, merely for
the sake of increasing their traffic, reduce their rates in favour
of individuals unless there is a sufficient consideration for such
reduction, which shall lessen the cost to the company of conveyance
or other services rendered to them by such individuals,&#8221; vol. 2,
p. 121. Probably this represented the general opinion of the legal
profession in 1875.</p>

<p>In the report for 1883 the Commissioners refer to &#8220;the fair pecuniary
interests generally of the company carrying&#8221; (p. 1.) as if they
might be taken into account.</p></div>

&#8220;The loss arising from the unnecessary multiplication
of train services, as well for the passengers as for the goods, the
avoidance of which was one of the principal motives which decided
the Prussian Government to purchase their railways, may be obviated
in this country, by a more intimate fusion of the interests of the
various railways, either by amalgamation or by the consolidation of
their interests in some other way, under the sanction of Parliament;
care being taken that the interests of the public in regard to
accommodation and charges are duly safeguarded. I have reason to
believe that, so far as the railways north of the Thames and west
of the metropolis are concerned, the more active and enlightened
directors are by no means unprepared for a step of the kind.&#8221;</p></div>

There is a large mileage of canals belonging to canal
companies, and considering the views expressed by some as to the
use which could be made of the canals which belong to the railway
companies, it would have been instructive if the proprietors of all
the independent canals had shown by the manner in which they had
maintained and worked them, that the railway companies&#8217; canals could
be more profitably and usefully worked than they now are.</p></div>

&#8220;Monopoly&#8221; is at present the favourite word of the
adversaries of railways; everything is permissible because railway
companies have a &#8220;monopoly.&#8221; This word has at least three senses.
Monopoly in the strict legal sense in which the Bank of England is
guaranteed by statute, the exclusive right of issuing notes within a
certain area; monopoly in the sense of being able to exclude other
competitors, because in a commercial point of view there is no room
for competition, or because the work could not be done more cheaply
or better by others. Messrs. W. H. Smith may be said to possess
a monopoly in this sense; monopoly is equivalent to property. No
railway company possesses a monopoly in the first sense. No company
is guaranteed against competition within any area, as many of them
know to their cost. Most attacks against railways are justified by
using the word, true in the second or third sense, as if true in the
first; and persons in eminent positions occasionally condescend to
sanction the use of this fallacy.</p></div>

Some difficulty has been experienced in checking the
rates contained in Sir B. Samuelson&#8217;s report owing to the distances
not being given, and from the name of the district being used
instead of the names of the places between which the rates are
shewn. For instance, although the South Wales Coalfields extend over
a very large area, a rate of 7s. 3d. per ton for coke is referred to
as from &#8220;South Wales to Darlaston,&#8221; on page 24 of the report; and in
like manner on pages 27 and 28 the rates for pig iron are given as
from &#8220;Cleveland and Northamptonshire.&#8221;</p></div>

The observation made in the report that the higher
rates in Germany are avoided by the intervention of forwarding
agents, who collect from small consignees, and make up the minimum
load, charging somewhat higher rates than for 5 or 10 ton lots,
shows that it was seen that, although the comparison of British
rates is made with them, the general public cannot obtain the
advantage of the low rates, because of the heavy minimum quantities.</p></div>
